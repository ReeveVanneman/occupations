In 1963 <a href="/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Recidivist" class="mw-redirect" title="Recidivist">recidivist</a> criminal <a href="/wiki/Randle_McMurphy" title="Randle McMurphy">Randle McMurphy</a> is moved to a mental institution after serving a short sentence on a <a href="/wiki/Prison_farm" title="Prison farm">prison farm</a> for statutory rape of a 15-year-old. Though not actually mentally ill, McMurphy hopes to avoid <a href="/wiki/Hard_labor" class="mw-redirect" title="Hard labor">hard labor</a> and serve the rest of his sentence in a relaxed environment. Upon arriving at the hospital, he finds the ward run by <a href="/wiki/Nurse_Ratched" title="Nurse Ratched">Nurse Ratched</a>, a steely <a href="/wiki/Passive-aggressive_behavior" title="Passive-aggressive behavior">passive-aggressive</a> tyrant who subtly intimidates her patients into doing her bidding.

The other patients include anxious, stuttering Billy Bibbit; Charlie Cheswick, who is prone to childish tantrums; delusional Martini; the well-educated, paranoid Dale Harding; belligerent Max Taber; epileptic Jim Sefelt; and "Chief" Bromden, a very tall <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> believed to be deaf and mute. Ratched soon sees McMurphy’s lively, rebellious presence as a threat to her authority, confiscating the patients’ cigarettes and rationing them. During his time in the ward, McMurphy gets into a battle of wits with Ratched. He steals a hospital bus, escaping with several patients to go on a fishing trip, encouraging his friends to become more self-confident.

McMurphy learns his sentence may become indefinite and he makes plans to escape, exhorting Chief to throw a <a href="/wiki/Hydrotherapy" title="Hydrotherapy">hydrotherapy</a> cart through a window. McMurphy, Chief, and Cheswick get into a fight with the orderlies after the latter becomes agitated over his stolen cigarettes. Ratched sends them to the "shock shop", where McMurphy discovers Chief can actually speak despite feigning being deaf and mute to avoid engaging with anyone. After being subjected to <a href="/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy" title="Electroconvulsive therapy">electroconvulsive therapy</a>, McMurphy returns to the ward pretending to have brain damage, although he reveals the treatment has charged him up even more. McMurphy and Chief make plans to escape, but decide to throw a secret <a href="/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> party for their friends after Ratched leaves for the night.

McMurphy sneaks two women, Candy and Rose, into the ward, and bribes the night guard. After a night of partying, McMurphy and Chief prepare to escape, inviting Billy to come with them. Not ready to leave the hospital, he refuses. McMurphy instead convinces him to have sex with Candy. Ratched arrives in the morning to find the ward in disarray and most of the patients passed out drunk. She discovers Billy and Candy together, the former now free of his stutter, until Ratched threatens to inform his mother about his escapade. Billy is overwhelmed with fear and locks himself in the doctor’s office where he commits suicide. The enraged McMurphy chokes Ratched, before being knocked out by an orderly.

Ratched comes back with a neck brace and a scratchy voice. Rumors spread that McMurphy has escaped in order to avoid being taken "upstairs". Later that night, Chief sees McMurphy being returned to his bed. He discovers that McMurphy has <a href="/wiki/Lobotomy" title="Lobotomy">lobotomy</a> scars on his forehead, and smothers his friend with a pillow. Chief finally throws the hydrotherapy cart through the window and escapes into the night, cheered on by Taber.
