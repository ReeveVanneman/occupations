Widowed Aurora Greenway (<a href="/wiki/Shirley_MacLaine" title="Shirley MacLaine">Shirley MacLaine</a>) keeps several suitors at arm's length, focusing instead on her close, but controlling, relationship with daughter Emma (<a href="/wiki/Debra_Winger" title="Debra Winger">Debra Winger</a>). Anxious to escape her mother, Emma marries young college professor Flap Horton (<a href="/wiki/Jeff_Daniels" title="Jeff Daniels">Jeff Daniels</a>) over her mother's objections, moves away, and has three children. Despite their frequent spats and difficulty getting along, Emma and Aurora have a tie between them that cannot be broken, and keep in touch by telephone.

Emma and Flap soon run into financial and marital difficulties. Emma has trouble managing the children and household, and she and Flap both have extramarital affairs. Emma relies increasingly on her mother for emotional support. Meanwhile, the lonely Aurora overcomes her repression, and begins a whirlwind romance with her next-door neighbor, retired <a href="/wiki/Astronaut" title="Astronaut">astronaut</a> Garrett Breedlove (<a href="/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>). 

The Horton family moves from Houston to Des Moines and eventually to Nebraska, apparently for Flap's career, but mostly so he can be near his girlfriend. Emma is diagnosed with cancer, which becomes terminal. Aurora stays by Emma's side through her treatment and hospitalization, even while dealing with her own pain after Garrett suddenly ends their relationship. The dying Emma shows her love for her mother by entrusting her own children to Aurora's care. After Emma's death, Garrett re-appears in the family's life, and begins to bond with Emma's young children.
