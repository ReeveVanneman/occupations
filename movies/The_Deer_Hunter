In the small working class town of <a href="/wiki/Clairton,_Pennsylvania" title="Clairton, Pennsylvania">Clairton, Pennsylvania</a>, in late 1967, steel workers Mike Vronsky, Steven Pushkov, and Nick Chevotarevich, with the support of their friends and co-workers Stan and Peter "Axel" Axelrod and local bar owner and friend John Welsh, prepare for two rites of passage: marriage and military service. Mike is a serious but unassuming leader; Steven the groom-to-be, pecked-at by his mother; and Nick the introspective man who loves deer hunting.

Before the trio ships out, Steven and his girlfriend Angela marry in a <a href="/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church" title="Russian Orthodox Church">Russian Orthodox</a> wedding. Mike works to control his feelings for Nick's girlfriend Linda. At the wedding reception held at the local <a href="/wiki/Veterans_of_Foreign_Wars" title="Veterans of Foreign Wars">VFW</a> hall, the guys drink, dance, sing, and enjoy the festivities, but then notice a soldier in a <a href="/wiki/U.S._Army_Special_Forces" class="mw-redirect" title="U.S. Army Special Forces">U.S. Army Special Forces</a> uniform. Mike attempts to ask what Vietnam is like, but the soldier ignores him. After Mike explains that he, Steven, and Nick are going to <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, the Green Beret raises his glass and says: "Fuck it". After being restrained from starting a fight, Mike goes back to the bar and raises his glass and toasts him with: "Fuck it!" The soldier glances over at Mike and grins.

Later, Steven and Angela drink from conjoined goblets - a traditional part of the Orthodox wedding ceremony. Superstition asserts that, if they drink without spilling any wine, they will have good luck for life. No one notices two drops of blood-red wine spill on her wedding gown. After Linda catches the bride's bouquet, Nick asks her to marry him and she agrees. Later that night, a drunken Mike runs through the town, stripping himself naked along the way. After Nick chases him down, he begs Mike not to leave him "over there" if anything happens in combat. The next day, Mike, Nick, Stan, John and Axel go deer hunting one last time. Mike is exasperated by his friends, especially Stan, who drinks and clowns, showing little respect for the ritual of hunting, which to Mike is a nearly sacred experience. Only Nick understands Mike's attitude, but he is more indulgent toward his friends. Mike goes hunting afterwards and kills a deer with one clean shot.

The friends return to Welsh's bar, with Michael's deer strapped to the hood of the car. They enter rambunctiously, spraying beers over each other and singing loudly. Welsh then makes his way to the piano and begins playing <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin" title="Frédéric Chopin">Chopin's</a> <a href="/wiki/Nocturnes,_Op._15_(Chopin)#Nocturne_in_G_minor,_Op._15,_No._3" title="Nocturnes, Op. 15 (Chopin)">Nocturne No. 6 Op. 15-3</a>.

In Vietnam, U.S. helicopters attack a village. An unconscious Mike (now a <a href="/wiki/Staff_Sergeant#United_States" class="mw-redirect" title="Staff Sergeant">Staff Sergeant</a> in the Special Forces) wakes up to see an NVA soldier shoot a woman carrying a baby. Mike kills him with a <a href="/wiki/Flamethrower" title="Flamethrower">flamethrower</a>. Meanwhile, a unit of <a href="/wiki/Bell_UH-1_Iroquois" title="Bell UH-1 Iroquois">UH-1</a> "Huey" helicopters drops off several U.S. infantrymen, Nick and Steven among them. Mike, Steven and Nick unexpectedly find each other just before they are captured and held in a <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> camp. For entertainment, the guards force the prisoners to play <a href="/wiki/Russian_roulette" title="Russian roulette">Russian roulette</a>, gambling on the outcome. All three friends are forced to play. Steven plays against Mike, who offers moral support, but Steven breaks down and points the gun upwards while pulling the trigger, grazing himself with the bullet when it discharges. As punishment, the guards put him into an underwater cage full of rats and dead bodies. Mike and Nick hatch a plan to escape by playing against each other, with Mike convincing the guards to let them play Russian roulette with three bullets in the gun. After a tense match, they kill their captors and escape.

After killing the guards, Mike rescues Steven. The three float downriver on a tree limb. An American helicopter finds them, but only Nick is able to climb aboard. The weakened Steven falls back into the water, and Mike plunges in the water to rescue him. Mike helps Steven to reach the river bank, but Steven's legs are broken, so Mike carries him through the jungle to friendly lines. Approaching a caravan of locals escaping the war zone, Mike stops a South Vietnamese military truck and places the wounded Steven on it, asking the soldiers to take care of him.

Nick recuperates in a <a href="/wiki/Military_hospital" title="Military hospital">military hospital</a> in Saigon with no knowledge of his friends, having suffered some form of stress-induced amnesia. After being released, he goes <a href="/wiki/AWOL" class="mw-redirect" title="AWOL">AWOL</a> and aimlessly stumbles through the <a href="/wiki/Red-light_district" title="Red-light district">red-light district</a> at night. He encounters Julien Grinda, a Frenchman, outside a gambling den where men play Russian roulette for money. Grinda entices the reluctant Nick to participate and leads him into the den. Mike is present in the den, watching the game, but the two friends do not notice each other at first. When Mike does see Nick, he is unable to get his attention. When Nick is introduced into the game, he grabs the gun, fires it at the current contestant, and then again at his own temple, causing the audience to riot in protest. Grinda hustles Nick outside to his car to escape the angry mob. Mike cannot catch up with them as they speed away.

Back in the U.S., Mike maintains a low profile. He tells a cab driver to drive past the house where all his friends are waiting, as he is embarrassed by the fuss Linda and the others have made, by arranging a welcome home party for him. He visits Linda the following day and grows close to her, but only because of the friend they both think they have lost. Mike goes to visit Angela at Steven's mother's home. Angela is barely responsive. When asked by Mike about Steven's whereabouts, she writes a phone number on a scrap of paper, which leads Mike to the local <a href="/wiki/Veterans_Health_Administration" title="Veterans Health Administration">VA hospital</a> where Steven has been for several months. Mike goes hunting with Axel, John, and Stan one more time, and after tracking a deer across the woods, fires into the air. He then sits on a rock escarpment and yells out, "OK?", which echoes back at him. He also berates Stan for carrying around a small revolver and waving it around, not realizing it is loaded. Mike visits Steven, who is now confined to a wheelchair, having had both legs amputated. Steven reveals that someone in Saigon has been mailing large amounts of money to him; Mike is convinced that it is Nick. Mike brings a reluctant Steven home to Angela and then travels to Saigon just before <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon" title="Fall of Saigon">its fall in 1975</a>.

He tracks down Grinda, who has made a lot of money from the Russian roulette-playing Nick. He finds Nick in a crowded gambling club, but Nick still has no recollection of his friends or his home. Mike enters the game of Russian roulette against Nick, hoping to jog his memory and persuade him to come home, but Nick's mind is gone. To keep him from taking another turn, Mike grabs Nick's arms, which are covered in scars from drug use. At the last moment, after Mike reminds Nick of their hunting trips together, Nick recognizes Mike and smiles. Nick raises the gun to his temple, and pulls the trigger, killing himself.

Back home in 1975, the friends have gathered for Nick's funeral, whom Mike has brought home, staying good to his promise. Together, they quietly sing 'God Bless America', and Mike offers a toast to the memory of Nick.
