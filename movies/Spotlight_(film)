In 1976, at a <a href="/wiki/Boston_Police_Department" title="Boston Police Department">Boston Police</a> station, two policemen discuss the arrest of <a href="/wiki/Priesthood_(Catholic_Church)" class="mw-redirect" title="Priesthood (Catholic Church)">Catholic priest</a> Fr. <a href="/wiki/John_Geoghan" title="John Geoghan">John Geoghan</a> for <a href="/wiki/Child_molestation" class="mw-redirect" title="Child molestation">child molestation</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Monsignor" title="Monsignor">high ranking cleric</a> talks to the mother of the children. The <a href="/wiki/District_attorney#Assistant_District_Attorney" title="District attorney">Assistant District Attorney</a> then enters the precinct and tells the policemen not to let the press get wind of what has happened. The arrest is hushed up, and the priest is released.

In 2001, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Boston_Globe" title="The Boston Globe">The Boston Globe</a></i> hires a new editor, <a href="/wiki/Martin_Baron" title="Martin Baron">Marty Baron</a>. Baron meets <a href="/wiki/Walter_V._Robinson" title="Walter V. Robinson">Walter "Robby" Robinson</a>, the editor of the newspaper's "Spotlight" team, a small group of journalists writing <a href="/wiki/Investigative_journalism" title="Investigative journalism">investigative articles</a> that take months to research and publish. After Baron reads a <i>Globe</i> column about a lawyer, <a href="/wiki/Mitchell_Garabedian" title="Mitchell Garabedian">Mitchell Garabedian</a>, who says that <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Francis_Law" title="Bernard Francis Law">Cardinal Bernard Law</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Boston" class="mw-redirect" title="Archbishop of Boston">Archbishop of Boston</a>) knew that <a href="/wiki/John_Geoghan" title="John Geoghan">John Geoghan</a> was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, he urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist <a href="/wiki/Michael_Rezendes" title="Michael Rezendes">Michael Rezendes</a> contacts Garabedian, who initially declines to be interviewed. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team, persuading Garabedian to talk.

Initially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved around several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, and an ongoing cover-up by the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Boston" title="Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston">Boston Archdiocese</a>. Through Phil Saviano, who heads the victims' rights group <a href="/wiki/Survivors_Network_of_those_Abused_by_Priests" title="Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests">Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests</a> (SNAP), they widen their search to 13 priests. They learn through <a href="/wiki/Richard_Sipe" title="Richard Sipe">Richard Sipe</a>, a former priest who worked at trying to rehabilitate <a href="/wiki/Pedophile" class="mw-redirect" title="Pedophile">pedophile</a> priests, that according to his experience over decades, 50% of priests are not celibate, though most are in relationships with other adults. He also surprises the journalists that his findings would suggest their estimate of the numbers of pedophile priests is low, and that there should be approximately 90 abusive priests in Boston (6% of priests). Through their research, they develop a list of 87 names, and begin to find their victims to back up their suspicions.

When the <a href="/wiki/September_11_attacks" title="September 11 attacks">September 11 attacks</a> occur, the team is forced to de-prioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was made aware of the problem and ignored it. Although Rezendes argues vociferously to run the story immediately before more victims suffer and rival newspapers publish, Robinson remains steadfast to research further so that the systemic problem can be more fully exposed. After the <i>Boston Globe</i> wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed that provide the evidence of that larger picture, the Spotlight team finally begins to write the story, and plan to publish their findings in early 2002.

As they are about to go to print, Robinson confesses to the team that he was sent a list of 20 pedophile priests by lawyer <a href="/wiki/Eric_MacLeish" title="Eric MacLeish">Eric MacLeish</a> in 1993, which he never followed up on. But Baron still commends him and his team's efforts to expose the crimes now. The story goes to print with a web link to the documents that expose Cardinal Law's inaction and a phone number for victims of pedophile priests. The following morning, the Spotlight team finds itself inundated with phone calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories.

A textual epilogue notes that Cardinal Law resigned in December 2002 and was eventually promoted to the <a href="/wiki/Basilica_di_Santa_Maria_Maggiore" class="mw-redirect" title="Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore">Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore</a> in <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> before presenting a list of places in the United States and around the world where major scandals involving abuse by priests took place.
