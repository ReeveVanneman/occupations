Broadcast journalist <a href="/wiki/Edward_R._Murrow" title="Edward R. Murrow">Edward R.

In 1872, an English gentleman <a href="/wiki/Phileas_Fogg" title="Phileas Fogg">Phileas Fogg</a> (<a href="/wiki/David_Niven" title="David Niven">David Niven</a>) claims he can circumnavigate the world in eighty days. He makes a <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" title="Pound sterling">£</a>20,000 wager (worth about £1.6&#160;million in 2015<sup id="cite_ref-inflation-UK_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-inflation-UK-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>) with four sceptical fellow members of the <a href="/wiki/Reform_Club" title="Reform Club">Reform Club</a> (each contributing £5,000 to the bet) that he can arrive back eighty days from exactly 8:45 pm that evening.

Together with his resourceful valet, <a href="/wiki/Jean_Passepartout" title="Jean Passepartout">Passepartout</a> (<a href="/wiki/Cantinflas" title="Cantinflas">Cantinflas</a>), Fogg goes hopscotching around the globe generously spending money to encourage others to help him get to his destinations faster so he can accommodate tight steamship schedules. They set out on the journey from Paris by a <a href="/wiki/Gas_balloon" title="Gas balloon">gas balloon</a> named La Coquette<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> upon learning the mountain train tunnel is blocked. The two accidentally end up in Spain, where Passepartout engages in a comic bullfight. Next, he goes to <a href="/wiki/Brindisi" title="Brindisi">Brindisi</a>. Meanwhile, suspicion grows that Fogg has stolen £55,000 (around £4.5&#160;million today<sup id="cite_ref-inflation-UK_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-inflation-UK-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>) from the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_England" title="Bank of England">Bank of England</a> so Police Inspector Fix (<a href="/wiki/Robert_Newton" title="Robert Newton">Robert Newton</a>) is sent out by <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Yard" title="Scotland Yard">Scotland Yard</a> to trail him (starting in Suez) and keeps waiting for a warrant to arrive so he can arrest Fogg in the British ports they visit. In India, Fogg and Passepartout rescue young widow Princess Aouda (<a href="/wiki/Shirley_MacLaine" title="Shirley MacLaine">Shirley MacLaine</a>) from <a href="/wiki/Sati_(practice)" title="Sati (practice)">being forced into a funeral pyre with her late husband</a>. The three visit Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, and the <a href="/wiki/Wild_West" class="mw-redirect" title="Wild West">Wild West</a>. After sailing across the Atlantic, and only hours short of winning his wager, Fogg is arrested upon arrival at Liverpool, by the diligent yet misguided Inspector Fix.

At the jail, the humiliated Fix informs Fogg that the real culprit was caught in <a href="/wiki/Brighton" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>. Although he is now exculpated, he has insufficient time to reach London before his deadline and thus has lost everything&#160;&#8211;&#32;but the love of the winsome Aouda. Salvation is at hand when, upon returning to London, Passepartout buys a newspaper and sees it is still Saturday. Fogg then realizes that by traveling east towards the rising sun and by crossing the <a href="/wiki/International_Date_Line" title="International Date Line">International Date Line</a>, he has gained a day. There is still time to reach the Reform Club and win the bet. Fogg arrives at the club just before the 8:45 pm chime. Aouda and Passepartout then arrive, surprising everyone, as no woman has ever entered the Reform Club before.
