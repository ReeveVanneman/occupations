The film covers the years 1529 to 1535, during the reign of <a href="/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England" title="Henry VIII of England">King Henry VIII</a>.

During a private late-night meeting at <a href="/wiki/Hampton_Court" class="mw-redirect" title="Hampton Court">Hampton Court</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_Wolsey" class="mw-redirect" title="Cardinal Wolsey">Cardinal Wolsey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> of England, chastises More for being the only member of the <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council" class="mw-redirect" title="Privy Council">Privy Council</a> to oppose Wolsey's attempts to obtain a divorce for King Henry VIII from the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" title="Holy See">Vatican</a> so that he can marry <a href="/wiki/Anne_Boleyn" title="Anne Boleyn">Anne Boleyn</a>, as his present queen, <a href="/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine</a>, has not produced a male heir, risking another period of dynastic wars like the <a href="/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses" title="Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>. More states that he can never go along with Wolsey's suggestion that they apply "pressure" on Church property and revenue in England. Unknown to More, the conversation is overheard by Wolsey's aide, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell" title="Thomas Cromwell">Thomas Cromwell</a>.

Returning to his home at <a href="/wiki/Chelsea,_London" title="Chelsea, London">Chelsea</a> at dawn, More finds his young acquaintance <a href="/wiki/Richard_Rich,_1st_Baron_Rich" title="Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich">Richard Rich</a> waiting for his return to lobby for a position at Court. More recommends instead that Rich find a job as a teacher. Rich declines More's advice, saying that has little prestige. More finds his daughter <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Roper" title="Margaret Roper">Meg</a> chatting with a brilliant young lawyer named <a href="/wiki/William_Roper_(biographer)" class="mw-redirect" title="William Roper (biographer)">William Roper</a>, who announces his desire to marry her. The devoutly <a href="/wiki/Catholic" class="mw-redirect" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> More states that he cannot give his blessing as long as Roper remains a <a href="/wiki/Lutheranism" title="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a>.

Some time later, Wolsey dies of a heart attack. King Henry appoints More as <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> of England to succeed Wolsey. The King makes an "impromptu" visit to the More estate, but More remains unmoved as Henry alternates between threats, tantrums, and promises of unbounded Royal favour. After the King leaves, Cromwell promises Rich a position at Court in return for damaging information about More.

Roper, learning of More's quarrel with the King, reveals that his religious opinions have altered considerably: He declares that by attacking the Church, the King has become "<a href="/wiki/The_Devil" class="mw-redirect" title="The Devil">the Devil</a>'s minister." More admonishes him to be more guarded as Rich arrives, pleading again for a position at Court. When More again refuses, Rich denounces More's steward as a spy for <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell" title="Thomas Cromwell">Thomas Cromwell</a>. An unmoved More responds, "Of course, that's one of my servants."

Humiliated, Rich joins Cromwell in attempting to bring down More. Meanwhile, the King has Parliament declare him "Supreme Head of the Church of England" and demands that bishops and Parliament renounce all allegiance to the Pope. More quietly resigns as Lord Chancellor rather than accept the new order. His close friend, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Howard,_3rd_Duke_of_Norfolk" title="Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk">Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk</a>, attempts to draw out his opinions in a friendly private chat, but More knows that the time for speaking openly of such matters is over.

Cromwell, in a meeting with Norfolk, implies that More's troubles would be over were he to attend the King's wedding to Anne Boleyn. When More declines the invitation, he is summoned again to Hampton Court, now occupied by Cromwell. More is interrogated, but refuses to answer. Infuriated, Cromwell declares that the King views him as a <a href="/wiki/Traitor" class="mw-redirect" title="Traitor">traitor</a>, but allows him to return home.

Upon returning home, Meg informs her father that a <a href="/wiki/Oath_of_Supremacy" title="Oath of Supremacy">new oath</a> is being circulated and that all must take it or face charges of <a href="/wiki/High_treason" title="High treason">high treason</a>. Initially, More says he would be willing to take the oath, provided it refers only to the King's marriage to Boleyn. Upon learning that it names the King as Supreme Head of the Church, More refuses to take it and is subsequently imprisoned in the <a href="/wiki/Tower_of_London" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>.

More remains steadfast in his refusal to take the Oath and refuses to explain his objections, knowing that he cannot be convicted if he hasn't explicitly denied the King's supremacy. A request for new books to read backfires, resulting in confiscation of the books he has, and Rich removes them from More's cell.

More is finally brought to trial, but refuses to speak about the marriage or why he will not take the Oath, and cites his silence in defence. Rich then testifies that when he came to take away More's books, More told him he would not take the Oath because the King could not be Head of the Church, thus committing treason by contradicting the Act of Supremacy. More is convicted of treason on the <a href="/wiki/Perjury" title="Perjury">perjured</a> testimony of Rich, who has been made Solicitor General for <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a> as a reward.

More says goodbye to his wife <a href="/wiki/Alice_More" title="Alice More">Alice</a>, Meg and Roper, urging them not to try to defend him. With nothing left to lose, More denounces the King's actions as illegal, citing the Biblical basis for the authority of the <a href="/wiki/Papacy" class="mw-redirect" title="Papacy">Papacy</a> over <a href="/wiki/Christendom" title="Christendom">Christendom</a> and further declaring that the Church's immunity to State interference is guaranteed both in <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> and in the King's own Coronation Oath. As the audience screams in protest, More is condemned to death by beheading. Before his execution on <a href="/wiki/Tower_Hill" title="Tower Hill">Tower Hill</a>, More pardons the executioner, and says, "I die His Majesty's good servant, but God's first."

A narrator intones the <a href="/wiki/Epilogue" title="Epilogue">epilogue</a>, listing the subsequent untimely deaths of the major characters, apart from Richard Rich, who "became Chancellor of England, and died in his bed."
