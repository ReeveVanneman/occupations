On his first day of school in Greenbow, <a href="/wiki/Alabama" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> in 1954, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran who, unlike the other children, immediately befriends him. Due to leg braces fitted to correct a curved spine, Forrest is unable to walk properly. One day, a young truck driver stays at the boarding house that Forrest lives in with his mother.  The young truck driver turns out to be <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, who, while playing guitar for him, becomes enthralled at the jerky hip thrusting movements that the hobbled Forrest makes while trying to dance.

Forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and marginal intelligence. One day, while trying to escape some bullies chasing him, his braces fall off revealing the young Forrest to be a very fast runner. Jenny yells to him, "Run, Forrest, run!" Despite his low <a href="/wiki/IQ" class="mw-redirect" title="IQ">IQ</a>, Forrest's new running ability leads to him receiving a football <a href="/wiki/Scholarship" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a> to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Alabama" title="University of Alabama">University of Alabama</a> in 1963, becoming a top <a href="/wiki/Running_back" title="Running back">running back</a>, being named on the <a href="/wiki/College_Football_All-America_Team" title="College Football All-America Team">All-American team</a>, and meeting President <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F.

While Forrest is in recovery for a gunshot wound to his buttocks received while saving his platoon-mates, he develops a talent for <a href="/wiki/Table_tennis" title="Table tennis">ping pong</a>. He becomes a ping pong celebrity and plays competitively against Chinese teams in <a href="/wiki/Ping_pong_diplomacy" class="mw-redirect" title="Ping pong diplomacy">ping pong diplomacy</a>. At an <a href="/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War" title="Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War">anti-war</a> rally, the "<a href="/wiki/National_Mobilization_Committee_to_End_the_War_in_Vietnam#1967_&quot;March_on_the_Pentagon&quot;" title="National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam">March on the Pentagon</a>", Forrest briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a <a href="/wiki/Hippie" title="Hippie">hippie</a> lifestyle.

Returning home, Forrest endorses a company that makes ping pong paddles. He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat, fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Lt. Dan joins Forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Carmen" title="Hurricane Carmen">Hurricane Carmen</a>, they pull in huge amounts of shrimp. They use their income to purchase a fleet of shrimp boats. Dan invests the money in <a href="/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple Computer</a> (which Forrest na√Øvely thinks is "some kind of fruit company") and Forrest is financially secure for the rest of his life but gives half of his earnings to Bubba's family.

In 1976, Jenny returns to visit Forrest, and he soon proposes to her. She declines but slips into his bedroom and makes love to him that night before leaving early the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest goes running. He decides to keep running across the country several times over three and a half years, becoming famous in the process.

In the present, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny who, having seen him run on television, asked him to visit her. Reunited with Jenny, she introduces him to his son, named Forrest Gump, Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an unknown virus (implied to be <a href="/wiki/HIV/AIDS" title="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>, which was an epidemic at the time). The three then move back to Greenbow. Jenny and Forrest finally marry but she dies a year later. Forrest and his son await the school bus on Forrest Jr.'s first day of school.
