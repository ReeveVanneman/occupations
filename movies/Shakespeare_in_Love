In 1593 London, William Shakespeare is a sometime player in the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain%27s_Men" title="Lord Chamberlain&#39;s Men">Lord Chamberlain's Men</a> and poor playwright for <a href="/wiki/Philip_Henslowe" title="Philip Henslowe">Philip Henslowe</a>, owner of <a href="/wiki/The_Rose_(theatre)" title="The Rose (theatre)">The Rose Theatre</a>. Shakespeare is working on a new comedy, <i>Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter</i>. Suffering from <a href="/wiki/Writer%27s_block" title="Writer&#39;s block">writer's block</a>, he has barely begun the play, and is further distracted by attempts both to seduce Rosaline, the mistress of <a href="/wiki/Richard_Burbage" title="Richard Burbage">Richard Burbage</a>, owner of the rival <a href="/wiki/Curtain_Theatre" title="Curtain Theatre">Curtain Theatre</a> and to convince Burbage to buy the play from Henslowe. Shakespeare receives helpful advice on his play from rival playwright <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe" title="Christopher Marlowe">Christopher "Kit" Marlowe</a>, but becomes despondent when he learns Rosaline is sleeping with <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Tylney" title="Edmund Tylney">Edmund Tilney</a>, the powerful <a href="/wiki/Master_of_the_Revels" title="Master of the Revels">Master of the Revels</a>. Henslowe, who is in debt to the ruthless moneylender Fennyman and in desperate need for a new play, begins auditions anyway.

Viola de Lesseps, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, who has seen Shakespeare's plays at court, disguises herself as a man named Thomas Kent to audition. "He" gains Shakespeare's interest when he auditions with a speech from <a href="/wiki/Two_Gentlemen_of_Verona" class="mw-redirect" title="Two Gentlemen of Verona">Two Gentlemen of Verona</a> after a series of actors bore him by reciting from Marlowe's <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Faustus_(play)" title="Doctor Faustus (play)">Doctor Faustus</a></i>, but when Shakespeare questions her, Viola runs away in fear of being discovered. Shakespeare pursues Kent to Viola's house and leaves a note with the nurse, asking Thomas Kent to begin rehearsals at the Rose. He sneaks into the house with the minstrels playing that night at the ball, where Viola's parents are arranging her betrothal to Lord Wessex, an impoverished aristocrat. While dancing with Viola, Shakespeare is struck speechless, but is forcibly ejected by Wessex. Wessex also asks Will's name, to which he replies that he is Christopher Marlowe after Wessex threatens to kill him. Shakespeare sneaks into Viola's garden, finding her on her balcony, where they briefly confess their mutual attraction to each other before he is discovered by her nurse and flees.

Inspired by Viola, Shakespeare writes quickly, completely transforming the play into what will become <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Rehearsals begin, with "Thomas Kent" as Romeo, the leading tragedian <a href="/wiki/Edward_Alleyn" title="Edward Alleyn">Ned Alleyn</a> as Mercutio and the stagestruck Fennyman given a small role as the Apothocary. Shakespeare soon discovers Viola's true identity, and they begin a secret affair.

Viola is summoned to court to receive approval for her proposed marriage to Lord Wessex. Shakespeare accompanies her, disguised as her female cousin. There, he persuades Wessex to wager £50 that a play can capture the true nature of love, the exact amount Shakespeare requires to buy a share in the Chamberlain's Men. <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> declares that she will judge the matter when the occasion arises.

When Burbage finds out that Shakespeare has both seduced Rosaline and cheated him out of the money he was paid for the play, he goes to the Rose Theatre with his Curtain Theatre Company and starts a brawl. The Rose Theatre company drives Burbage and his company out and then celebrate at the local pub, where a drunken Henslowe lets slip to a horrified Viola that Shakespeare is married, albeit separated from his wife. News arrives that Marlowe has been murdered, and a guilt-ridden Shakespeare believes Wessex has had Marlowe killed, believing him to be Viola's lover. Viola briefly believes Shakespeare has been murdered but he appears at her church, terrifying Wessex who believes he is a ghost. Viola confesses her love for Shakespeare, but both recognize she cannot escape her duty to marry Wessex.

<a href="/wiki/John_Webster" title="John Webster">John Webster</a>, an unpleasant young boy who hangs around the theatre, spies on Shakespeare and Viola making love and informs Tilney, who closes the Rose for breaking the ban on women actors. Viola's identity is exposed, leaving them without a stage or lead actor, until Richard Burbage offers them his theatre and the heartbroken Shakespeare takes the role of Romeo. Following her wedding, Viola learns that the play will be performed that day, and runs away to the Curtain. Planning to watch with the crowd, Viola overhears that the boy playing Juliet cannot perform, <a href="/wiki/Voice_change" title="Voice change">his voice having broken</a> overnight, and Henslowe asks her to replace him. She plays Juliet to Shakespeare's Romeo to an enthralled audience.

Master Tilney arrives to arrest everyone for indecency due to Viola's presence, but the Queen reveals herself having been in attendance and restrains Tilney, instead asserting that Kent's resemblance to a woman is, indeed, remarkable. However, even a queen is powerless to end a lawful marriage, and she orders Kent to "fetch" Viola because she must sail with Wessex to the <a href="/wiki/Colony_of_Virginia" title="Colony of Virginia">Colony of Virginia</a>. The Queen also tells Wessex, who followed Viola to the theatre, that <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> has won the bet for Shakespeare, and has Kent deliver his £50 with instructions to write something "a little more cheerful next time, for <a href="/wiki/Twelfth_Night_(holiday)" title="Twelfth Night (holiday)">Twelfth Night</a>".

Viola and Shakespeare say their goodbyes, and he vows to immortalise her, as he imagines the beginning of <i><a href="/wiki/Twelfth_Night" title="Twelfth Night">Twelfth Night</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Viola_(Twelfth_Night)" title="Viola (Twelfth Night)">in character</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Castaway" title="Castaway">castaway</a> disguised as a man after a voyage to a strange land.
