A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish <a href="/wiki/Workhouse" title="Workhouse">workhouse</a> and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist (<a href="/wiki/John_Howard_Davies" title="John Howard Davies">John Howard Davies</a>) by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: <a href="/wiki/Beadle" title="Beadle">beadle</a> Mr. Bumble (<a href="/wiki/Francis_L._Sullivan" title="Francis L. Sullivan">Francis L. Sullivan</a>) and matron Mrs. Corney (<a href="/wiki/Mary_Clare" title="Mary Clare">Mary Clare</a>). At the age of nine, the hungry children <a href="/wiki/Drawing_straws" title="Drawing straws">draw straws</a>; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of <a href="/wiki/Gruel" title="Gruel">gruel</a> ("Please sir, I want some more").

For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry (<a href="/wiki/Gibb_McLaughlin" title="Gibb McLaughlin">Gibb McLaughlin</a>), from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping.

Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger (<a href="/wiki/Anthony_Newley" title="Anthony Newley">Anthony Newley</a>), a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin (<a href="/wiki/Alec_Guinness" title="Alec Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>), an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow (<a href="/wiki/Henry_Stephenson" title="Henry Stephenson">Henry Stephenson</a>), a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. A witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin (<a href="/wiki/Amy_Veness" title="Amy Veness">Amy Veness</a>).

Meanwhile, Fagin is visited by the mysterious Monks (<a href="/wiki/Ralph_Truman" title="Ralph Truman">Ralph Truman</a>), who has a strong interest in Oliver. He sends Monks to Bumble and Mrs. Corney (now Bumble's domineering wife); Monks buys from them the only thing that can identify Oliver's parentage, a locket containing his mother's portrait.

By chance, Fagin's associate, the vicious Bill Sykes (<a href="/wiki/Robert_Newton" title="Robert Newton">Robert Newton</a>), and Sykes' kind-hearted prostitute girlfriend (and former Fagin pupil) Nancy (<a href="/wiki/Kay_Walsh" title="Kay Walsh">Kay Walsh</a>) run into Oliver on the street and forcibly take him back to Fagin. Nancy feels pangs of guilt and, seeing a poster in which Mr. Brownlow offers a reward for Oliver's return, contacts the gentleman and promises to deliver Oliver the next day. The suspicious Fagin, however, has had the Dodger follow her. When Fagin informs Sykes, the latter becomes enraged and murders her, mistakenly believing that she has betrayed him.

The killing brings down the wrath of the public on the gang â€” particularly Sykes who attempts to make his escape by taking Oliver hostage. Clambering over the rooftops, and with climbing rope hung around his neck, Sykes is shot by one of the mob and is accidentally hanged as he loses his footing. Mr. Brownlow and the authorities rescue Oliver. Fagin and his other associates are rounded up. Monks' part in the proceedings is discovered, and he is arrested. He was trying to ensure his inheritance; Oliver, it turns out, is Mr. Brownlow's grandson. For their involvement in Monks' scheme, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble lose their jobs at the workhouse. Oliver is happily reunited with his newly found grandfather and Mrs. Bedwin, his search for love ending in fulfilment.
