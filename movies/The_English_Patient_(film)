In the final days of the <a href="/wiki/Italian_Campaign_(World_War_II)" title="Italian Campaign (World War II)">Italian Campaign of World War II</a>, Hana, a <a href="/wiki/French-Canadian" class="mw-redirect" title="French-Canadian">French-Canadian</a> <a href="/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Army_Medical_Corps" title="Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps">nurse</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Army_Medical_Corps" title="Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps">Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps</a>, obtains permission from her unit to move into a bombed-out <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italian</a> <a href="/wiki/Monastery" title="Monastery">monastery</a>, to look after a dying, critically burned man who speaks English but cannot remember his name. The patient's only possession is a copy of <a href="/wiki/Histories_(Herodotus)" title="Histories (Herodotus)">Herodotus' Histories</a> with notes, pictures and mementos contained inside. They are soon joined by Kip, a <a href="/wiki/Sikh" class="mw-redirect" title="Sikh">Sikh</a> <a href="/wiki/Sapper" title="Sapper">sapper</a> in the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" title="British Army">British Army</a> posted with his sergeant to clear mines and unexploded bombs in the local area, including one in the monastery where Hana and the English Patient are residing. David Caravaggio, a <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Intelligence_Corps" title="Canadian Intelligence Corps">Canadian Intelligence Corps</a> operative who has no thumbs as a result of torture during a German interrogation, also arrives to stay at the monastery. Caravaggio questions the patient, who gradually reveals his past to him, Hana and Kip through a series of flashbacks.

The patient tells Hana and Caravaggio that, in the late 1930s, he was exploring a region of the <a href="/wiki/Sahara" title="Sahara">Sahara</a> Desert near the Egyptian-Libyan border. He is revealed to be <a href="/wiki/Hungarians" title="Hungarians">Hungarian</a> <a href="/wiki/Cartography" title="Cartography">cartographer</a> <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Alm%C3%A1sy" title="László Almásy">Count László de Almásy</a>, who was mapping the <a href="/wiki/Sahara" title="Sahara">Sahara</a> as part of a <a href="/wiki/Royal_Geographical_Society" title="Royal Geographical Society">Royal Geographical Society</a> <a href="/wiki/Archaeology" title="Archaeology">archeological</a> and <a href="/wiki/Surveying" title="Surveying">surveying</a> expedition in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and Libya with a group including his good friend, Englishman Peter Madox. Their expedition is joined by a British couple, Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who own a new plane and are to contribute to the aerial survey efforts. Almásy is given clues by a local Bedouin man which help the group to discover the location of the <a href="/wiki/Cave_of_Swimmers" title="Cave of Swimmers">Cave of Swimmers</a>, an ancient site of cave paintings in the <a href="/wiki/Gilf_Kebir" title="Gilf Kebir">Gilf Kebir</a>. The group begin to document their find, during which time Almásy falls in love with Katharine. He writes about her in notes folded into his book, which Katharine discovers when Almásy awkwardly accepts her offer of two watercolours she has painted of the cave imagery, and asks her to paste them into the book. The two begin an affair on their return to Cairo, while the group arranges for more detailed archaeological surveys of the cave and the surrounding area. Almásy buys a silver <a href="/wiki/Thimble" title="Thimble">thimble</a> in the market as a gift to Katharine. Some months later, Katharine abruptly ends their affair from fear her husband Geoffrey will discover it. Shortly afterwards the archaeological projects are halted due to the onset of the war. Madox leaves his <a href="/wiki/De_Havilland_Tiger_Moth" title="De Havilland Tiger Moth">Tiger Moth</a> aeroplane at <a href="/wiki/Kufra" title="Kufra">Kufra Oasis</a> before his intended return to Britain.

Over the days while Almásy relates his story, Hana and Kip begin a shy love affair, but Kip is reposted once he has cleared the area of explosives. They agree they will meet again.

While Almásy is packing up the base camp at the cave site, Geoffrey, in an attempted <a href="/wiki/Murder-suicide" class="mw-redirect" title="Murder-suicide">murder-suicide</a> having apparently long known about the affair between Almásy and Katharine, deliberately crashes his own  <a href="/wiki/Boeing-Stearman_Model_75" title="Boeing-Stearman Model 75">Boeing-Stearman</a> plane, narrowly missing Almásy. Geoffrey is killed instantly and Katharine is seriously injured. Almásy carries her to the Cave of Swimmers, realising she is wearing the thimble he gave to her on a chain around her neck. She confesses that she has always loved him despite ending their affair. After leaving her with provisions, Almásy begins a three-day walk across the desert to get help. At British-held <a href="/wiki/El_Tag" title="El Tag">El Tag</a> he attempts to explain the situation, but on revealing his name, is detained on suspicion of being a German spy and transported on a train. He escapes from the train, and soon afterwards comes in contact with a German army unit. They transport him to Madox's sequestered plane at Kufra Oasis, where he exchanges its stored survey maps for fuel, enabling him to fly back to the cave. However, he finds that Katharine has since died. He takes a letter she has written to him by torchlight to fold into his book, and he flies himself and Katharine's body away. Before long, though, the plane is shot down by German anti-aircraft guns. Almásy is badly burned and is rescued by a group of <a href="/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouin</a>, who bring him to the <a href="/wiki/Siwa_Oasis" title="Siwa Oasis">Siwa Oasis</a> from where he is moved to Italy. 

After he has related his story, Almásy indicates to Hana that he wishes to die, pushing several unopened vials of morphine towards her as she gives him his regular injection for pain relief. Though visibly upset, she grants his wishes for a compassionate death and reads Katharine's final letter to him as he dies. She and Caravaggio leave the monastery for Florence with a passing army truck, and she hugs Almásy's book to herself as she rides away.
