General <a href="/wiki/George_S._Patton" title="George S. Patton">George S. Patton</a> <a href="/wiki/Patton%27s_Speech_to_the_Third_Army" class="mw-redirect" title="Patton&#39;s Speech to the Third Army">addresses</a> an unseen audience of American troops to raise their morale, focusing in particular on the value placed on winning by American society.

Following the humiliating American defeat at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Kasserine_Pass" class="mw-redirect" title="Battle of the Kasserine Pass">Battle of the Kasserine Pass</a> in 1943, Patton is placed in charge of the <a href="/wiki/II_Corps_(United_States)" title="II Corps (United States)">American II Corps</a> in <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>. Upon his arrival, he immediately starts enforcing discipline among his troops. Patton is then summoned to a meeting with <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Coningham_(RAF_officer)" title="Arthur Coningham (RAF officer)">Air Marshal Coningham</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>, where he claims that the American defeat was caused by lack of air cover. Coningham promises Patton that he will see no more German aircraft – but seconds later the compound is strafed by <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> planes. Patton then defeats a German attack at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_El_Guettar" title="Battle of El Guettar">Battle of El Guettar</a>; his aide Captain Jenson is killed in the battle, and is replaced by <a href="/wiki/Charles_R._Codman" title="Charles R. Codman">Lieutenant Colonel Codman</a>. Patton is bitterly disappointed to learn that <a href="/wiki/Erwin_Rommel" title="Erwin Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>, commander of the <a href="/wiki/Panzer_Army_Africa#German-Italian_Panzer_Army" title="Panzer Army Africa">German-Italian Panzer Army</a>, was on medical leave, but Codman reassures him that: "If you've defeated Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel."

After success in the North Africa campaign, Patton and <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Montgomery" title="Bernard Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a> come up with competing plans for the <a href="/wiki/Allied_invasion_of_Sicily" title="Allied invasion of Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>. Patton's proposal to land his Seventh Army in the northwest of the island with Montgomery in the southeast (therefore potentially trapping the German and Italian forces in a pincer movement) initially impresses their superior <a href="/wiki/Harold_Alexander,_1st_Earl_Alexander_of_Tunis" title="Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis">General Alexander</a>, but General Eisenhower rejects it in favor of Montgomery's more cautious plan, which places Patton's army in the southeast, covering Montgomery's flank. While the landing is successful, the Allied forces become bogged down, causing Patton to defy orders and advance northwest to Palermo, and then to the port of Messina in the northeast, narrowly beating Montgomery to the prize, although several thousand German and Italian troops are able to flee the island. Patton insists that his feud with Montgomery is due to the latter's determination to be the "war hero," and to deny the Americans any chance of glory. However, his actions do not sit well with his subordinates <a href="/wiki/General_Omar_Bradley" class="mw-redirect" title="General Omar Bradley">Bradley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lucian_Truscott" title="Lucian Truscott">Lucian Truscott</a>.

While on a visit to a field hospital, Patton notices a <a href="/wiki/Shell-shocked" class="mw-redirect" title="Shell-shocked">shell-shocked</a> soldier crying. Calling him a coward, Patton <a href="/wiki/George_S._Patton_slapping_incidents" title="George S. Patton slapping incidents">slaps the soldier</a> and even threatens to shoot him, before demanding his immediate return to the front line. Patton is relieved of command and, by order of Eisenhower, forced to apologize to the soldier, others present, and to his entire command. As a result, he is also sidelined during the <a href="/wiki/Normandy_landings" title="Normandy landings">D-Day</a> landings in 1944, being placed in command of the decoy phantom <a href="/wiki/First_United_States_Army_Group" title="First United States Army Group">First United States Army Group</a> in southeast England. German General <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Jodl" title="Alfred Jodl">Alfred Jodl</a> is convinced that Patton will lead the invasion of Europe.

After begging his former subordinate Bradley for a command before the war ends, Patton is placed under him in command of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Central" title="United States Army Central">Third Army</a> and performs brilliantly by rapidly advancing through France, but his tanks are brought to a standstill when they run out of fuel – the supplies being allocated to Montgomery's bold <a href="/wiki/Operation_Market_Garden" title="Operation Market Garden">Operation Market Garden</a>, much to his fury. Later, during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge" title="Battle of the Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>, Patton brilliantly relieves the town of <a href="/wiki/Bastogne" title="Bastogne">Bastogne</a> and then smashes through the <a href="/wiki/Siegfried_Line" title="Siegfried Line">Siegfried Line</a> and into Germany.

At a war drive in Knutsford, England, General Patton remarks that the United States and the United Kingdom would dominate the post-war world, viewed as an insult to the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. After Germany capitulates, Patton directly insults a Russian general at a dinner; the Russian insults Patton right back, much to Patton's amusement. Patton then makes an offhand remark comparing the Nazi Party to American political parties. Ultimately, Patton's outspokenness loses him his command once again, though he is kept on to see to the rebuilding of Germany, where a runaway oxcart narrowly misses him.

Finally, Patton is seen walking Willie, his <a href="/wiki/Bull_terrier" class="mw-redirect" title="Bull terrier">bull terrier</a>, across the German countryside. Patton's <a href="/wiki/Voice-over" title="Voice-over">voice is heard</a> relating that a returning hero of ancient Rome was honored with a "triumph," a victory parade in which "a slave stood behind the conqueror, holding a golden crown, and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory ... is fleeting."
