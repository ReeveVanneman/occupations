The story begins with a <a href="/wiki/Silent_film" title="Silent film">silent film</a> sequence during which the good Squire Allworthy returns home after a lengthy stay in London and discovers a baby in his bed. Thinking that his barber, Mr. Partridge, and one of his servants, Jenny Jones, have "birthed" the infant out of lust, the squire banishes them and chooses to raise little Tom Jones as if he were his own son, and Tom loves him like a father.

Tom grows up to be a lively young man whose good looks and kind heart make him very popular with the opposite sex. However, he truly loves only one woman, the gentle Sophie Western, who returns his passion. Sadly, Tom is stigmatized as a "<a href="/wiki/Illegitimacy" class="mw-redirect" title="Illegitimacy">bastard</a>" and cannot wed a young lady of her high station. Sophie, too, must hide her feelings while her aunt and her father, Squire Western try to coerce her to marry a more suitable man â€“ a man whom she hates.

This young man is Blifil, the son of Squire Allworthy's widowed sister Bridget. Although he is of legitimate birth, he is an ill-natured fellow with plenty of hypocritical 'virtue' but none of Tom's warmth, honesty, or high spirits. When Bridget dies unexpectedly, Blifil intercepts a letter, which his mother intended for his uncle's eyes only. The letter's contents are not revealed; however, after his mother's funeral, Blifil and his two tutors, Mr. Thwackum and Mr. Square, join forces to convince the squire that Tom is a villain. Allworthy gives Tom a small cash legacy and sorrowfully sends him out into the world to seek his fortune.

In his road-travelling odyssey, Tom is knocked unconscious while defending the good name of his beloved Sophie and robbed of his legacy. He also flees from a jealous Irishman who falsely accuses him of having an affair with his wife, engages in deadly <a href="/wiki/Swordsmanship" title="Swordsmanship">sword fights</a>, meets his alleged father and his alleged mother, a certain Mrs. Waters, whom he saves from an evil Redcoat Officer, and later beds the same Mrs. Waters. In a celebrated scene, Tom and Mrs. Waters sit opposite each other in the dining room of the Upton Inn, wordlessly consuming an enormous meal while gazing lustfully at each other.

Meanwhile, Sophie runs away from home soon after Tom's banishment to escape the attentions of the loathed Blifil. After narrowly missing each other at the Upton Inn, Tom and Sophie arrive separately in London. There, Tom attracts the attention of Lady Bellaston, a promiscuous noblewoman over 40 years of age. She is rich, beautiful, and completely <a href="/wiki/Amoralism" class="mw-redirect" title="Amoralism">amoral</a>, though Tom goes to her bed willingly and is generously rewarded for his services. Eventually, Tom ends up at <a href="/wiki/Tyburn,_London" class="mw-redirect" title="Tyburn, London">Tyburn Gaol</a>, facing a boisterous hanging crowd after two <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scoundrel" class="extiw" title="wikt:scoundrel">blackguardly</a> agents of Blifil frame him for robbery and <a href="/wiki/Attempted_murder" title="Attempted murder">attempted murder</a>. Allworthy learns the contents of the mysterious letter: Tom is not Jenny Jones's child, but Bridget's illegitimate son and Allworthy's nephew. Furthermore, since Blifil knew this, concealed it, and tried to destroy his half-brother, he is now in disgrace and disinherited.  Allworthy uses this knowledge to get Tom a pardon, but Tom has already been conveyed to the gallows; his hanging is begun, but is interrupted by Squire Western, who cuts him down and takes him to Sophie.  Tom now has permission to court Sophie, and all ends well with Tom embracing Sophie with Squire Western's blessing.
