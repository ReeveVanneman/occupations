In late 1975, the <a href="/wiki/Heavyweight" title="Heavyweight">heavyweight</a> <a href="/wiki/Boxing" title="Boxing">boxing</a> world champion, Apollo Creed, announces plans to hold a <a href="/wiki/Title_bout" class="mw-redirect" title="Title bout">title bout</a> in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> during the upcoming <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bicentennial" title="United States Bicentennial">United States Bicentennial</a>. However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him. He settles in on <a href="/wiki/Rocky_Balboa" title="Rocky Balboa">Robert "Rocky" Balboa</a>, an aspiring <a href="/wiki/Southpaw_stance" title="Southpaw stance">southpaw</a> boxer from an Italian neighborhood of Philadelphia, known by the nickname "The Italian Stallion".

Rocky meets with <a href="/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)" title="Promoter (entertainment)">promoter</a> Miles Jergens, unexpectedly presuming Creed is seeking local sparring partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. After several weeks of training, using whatever he can find, including meat carcasses as <a href="/wiki/Punching_bag" title="Punching bag">punching bags</a>, Rocky accepts an offer of assistance from former boxer Mickey "Mighty Mick" Goldmill, a respected trainer and former <a href="/wiki/Bantamweight" title="Bantamweight">bantamweight</a> fighter from the 1920s, who always criticized Rocky for wasting his potential.

Meanwhile, Rocky meets Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at the J&amp;M Tropical Fish <a href="/wiki/Pet_store" title="Pet store">pet store</a>. He begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian, culminating in a kiss. Adrian's brother, Paulie, becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky calms him by agreeing to advertise his <a href="/wiki/Meat_packing_industry" title="Meat packing industry">meatpacking business</a> before the upcoming fight. The night before the fight, Rocky begins to lose confidence after touring the arena. He confesses to Adrian that he does not expect to win, but is content to <a href="/wiki/The_distance_(boxing)" title="The distance (boxing)">go the distance</a> against Creed and prove himself to everyone.

On <a href="/wiki/New_Year%27s_Day" title="New Year&#39;s Day">New Year's Day</a>, the fight is held, with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as <a href="/wiki/George_Washington" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> and then <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Sam" title="Uncle Sam">Uncle Sam</a>. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first roundâ€”the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humiliated, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries, Rocky with a detached retina in his right eye and hits to the head, and Apollo with internal bleeding and a broken rib. As the fight progresses, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.

After the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was "the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.
