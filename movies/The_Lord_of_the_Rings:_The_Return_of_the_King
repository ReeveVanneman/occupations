Two <a href="/wiki/Hobbit" title="Hobbit">Hobbits</a>, Sméagol and <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A9agol" title="Déagol">Déagol</a>, are fishing when Déagol discovers the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">One Ring</a> in the river. Sméagol is ensnared by the Ring, and kills his friend for it. He retreats into the <a href="/wiki/Misty_Mountains" title="Misty Mountains">Misty Mountains</a> as the Ring twists his body and mind, until he becomes the creature <a href="/wiki/Gollum" title="Gollum">Gollum</a>.

Centuries later, <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> leads <a href="/wiki/Aragorn" title="Aragorn">Aragorn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Legolas" title="Legolas">Legolas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gimli_(Middle-earth)" title="Gimli (Middle-earth)">Gimli</a>, and King <a href="/wiki/Th%C3%A9oden" title="Théoden">Théoden</a> to <a href="/wiki/Isengard" title="Isengard">Isengard</a>, where they reunite with <a href="/wiki/Meriadoc_Brandybuck" title="Meriadoc Brandybuck">Merry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peregrin_Took" title="Peregrin Took">Pippin</a>. Gandalf retrieves the defeated <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr" title="Palantír">palantír</a></i>. Pippin later looks into the seeing-stone, and is telepathically attacked by <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a>. Gandalf deduces that Sauron will attack <a href="/wiki/Gondor" title="Gondor">Gondor</a>'s capital <a href="/wiki/Minas_Tirith" title="Minas Tirith">Minas Tirith</a>. He rides there to warn Gondor's steward <a href="/wiki/Denethor" title="Denethor">Denethor</a>, taking Pippin with him.

Gollum leads <a href="/wiki/Frodo_Baggins" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo Baggins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee" title="Samwise Gamgee">Samwise Gamgee</a> to <a href="/wiki/Minas_Morgul" title="Minas Morgul">Minas Morgul</a>. The hobbits begin climbing a stair carved in the cliff face that will take them into Mordor via a 'secret way' - unaware that Gollum plans to kill them and take the Ring. Sauron's army strikes and overwhelms <a href="/wiki/Osgiliath" class="mw-redirect" title="Osgiliath">Osgiliath</a>, forcing <a href="/wiki/Faramir" title="Faramir">Faramir</a> and his garrison to retreat to Minas Tirith.

Gollum disposes of the Hobbits' food, blaming Sam. Frodo tells Sam to go home, before Frodo and Gollum continue to the tunnel leading to Mordor, where Gollum tricks him into venturing into the lair of the giant spider <a href="/wiki/Shelob" title="Shelob">Shelob</a>. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, telling him that he must destroy the Ring for both their sakes. Gollum attacks Frodo, but falls down a chasm. Frodo continues on, but Shelob discovers, paralyses and binds him. However, Sam arrives and drives her away. Sam hides as <a href="/wiki/Orc" title="Orc">Orcs</a> appear and take Frodo with them. Sam follows the Orcs into the Tower of <a href="/wiki/Cirith_Ungol" class="mw-redirect" title="Cirith Ungol">Cirith Ungol</a>, and frees Frodo so they can continue their journey.

Aragorn learns from <a href="/wiki/Elrond" title="Elrond">Elrond</a> that <a href="/wiki/Arwen" title="Arwen">Arwen</a> is dying, having refused to leave Middle Earth after seeing a vision of <a href="/wiki/Eldarion" title="Eldarion">her son with Aragorn</a>. Elrond gives Aragorn <a href="/wiki/And%C3%BAril" class="mw-redirect" title="Andúril">Andúril</a>, <a href="/wiki/Isildur" title="Isildur">Isildur</a>'s sword <a href="/wiki/Narsil" class="mw-redirect" title="Narsil">Narsil</a> reforged, so he can reclaim his birthright while gaining reinforcements from the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Men_of_Dunharrow" title="Dead Men of Dunharrow">Dead Men of Dunharrow</a>. Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels to the <a href="/wiki/Paths_of_the_Dead" title="Paths of the Dead">Paths of the Dead</a>, recruiting the Army of the Dead by pledging to release them from the curse Isildur put on them. Faramir is gravely wounded after a futile effort to retake Osgiliath; believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf is left to defend the city against the Orc army, led by <a href="/wiki/Gothmog_(Third_Age)" title="Gothmog (Third Age)">Gothmog</a>. As Gothmog's army forces its way into the city, Denethor attempts to kill himself and Faramir on a <a href="/wiki/Pyre" title="Pyre">pyre</a>. Pippin alerts Gandalf and they save Faramir, but Denethor leaps to his death from the top of Minas Tirith just before Théoden and his nephew, <a href="/wiki/%C3%89omer" title="Éomer">Éomer</a>, arrive with the Rohirrim. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Pelennor_Fields" title="Battle of the Pelennor Fields">ensuing battle</a>, they are overwhelmed by the <a href="/wiki/Oliphaunt" class="mw-redirect" title="Oliphaunt">Oliphaunt</a>-riding <a href="/wiki/Haradrim" class="mw-redirect" title="Haradrim">Haradrim</a>, while the <a href="/wiki/Witch-king_of_Angmar" title="Witch-king of Angmar">Witch-king of Angmar</a> mortally wounds Théoden. Though Théoden's niece <a href="/wiki/%C3%89owyn" title="Éowyn">Éowyn</a> destroys the Witch-King with Merry's help, Théoden dies of his wounds. Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead, who overcome the Orcs and win the battle; Aragorn then frees them from the curse. Aragorn decides to lead his army upon the Black Gate as a distraction, so Frodo and Sam can get to <a href="/wiki/Mount_Doom" title="Mount Doom">Mount Doom</a>.

Aragorn's army <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Morannon" title="Battle of the Morannon">draw out Sauron's forces</a> and empties Mordor, allowing Frodo and Sam to reach the volcano, but Gollum attacks them just as they reach Mount Doom. Frodo succumbs to the Ring and claims it as his own. Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off to reclaim the Ring. Frodo fights back and knocks Gollum, who is holding the Ring, into the volcano, destroying the Ring and killing Gollum. As Frodo and Sam escape, Sauron is destroyed and Mordor crumbles. Gandalf flies in with <a href="/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" title="Eagle (Middle-earth)">eagles</a> to rescue the Hobbits, who awaken later in Minas Tirith and are reunited with the surviving Fellowship members. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and takes Arwen as his queen. The Hobbits return to the <a href="/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)" title="Shire (Middle-earth)">Shire</a>, where Sam marries <a href="/wiki/Rosie_Cotton" class="mw-redirect" title="Rosie Cotton">Rosie Cotton</a>. A few years later, Frodo departs Middle Earth for the <a href="/wiki/Undying_Lands" class="mw-redirect" title="Undying Lands">Undying Lands</a> with his uncle <a href="/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins" title="Bilbo Baggins">Bilbo</a>, Gandalf, and the Elves. He leaves Sam the <a href="/wiki/Red_Book_of_Westmarch" title="Red Book of Westmarch">Red Book of Westmarch</a>, which details their adventures. Sam then returns to the Shire, where he embraces Rosie and their children.
