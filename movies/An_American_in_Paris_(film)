American <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> <a href="/wiki/Veteran" title="Veteran">veteran</a> Jerry Mulligan (<a href="/wiki/Gene_Kelly" title="Gene Kelly">Gene Kelly</a>) is an exuberant expatriate in Paris trying to make a reputation as a <a href="/wiki/Painting" title="Painting">painter</a>. His friend and neighbor, Adam Cook (<a href="/wiki/Oscar_Levant" title="Oscar Levant">Oscar Levant</a>), is a struggling concert pianist and longtime associate of a French singer, Henri Baurel (<a href="/wiki/Georges_Gu%C3%A9tary" title="Georges Guétary">Georges Guétary</a>). At the ground-floor bar, Henri tells Adam about his cultured girlfriend, Lise Bouvier (<a href="/wiki/Leslie_Caron" title="Leslie Caron">Leslie Caron</a>).  Jerry joins them later, before going out to sell his art.

A lonely society woman and heiress, Milo Roberts (<a href="/wiki/Nina_Foch" title="Nina Foch">Nina Foch</a>), finds Jerry displaying his paintings in <a href="/wiki/Montmartre" title="Montmartre">Montmartre</a> and takes an interest in him and his art.  She brings him to her apartment to pay for his works, and invites him to a dinner party she is throwing later that night. After singing with French children on the way home ("<a href="/wiki/I_Got_Rhythm" title="I Got Rhythm">I Got Rhythm</a>"), Jerry goes up to Milo's apartment.  He quickly finds out the "party" is actually a one-on-one date, and tells Milo he has no interest in being a paid escort.  When he attempts to leave after giving her money back, she insists she is only interested in his art.

They go to a crowded bar, and Milo offers to sponsor an art show for Jerry as a friendly gesture.  Some of Milo's friends arrive, and while sitting with them, Jerry sees Lise seated with friends at the next table, and is instantly smitten. He ignores Milo and her acquaintances, and instead pretends to know Lise already and dances with her.  She is standoffish and gives Jerry a wrong phone number, but is innocently corrected by someone at her table.  Heading home, Milo tells Jerry he was very rude cavorting with a girl he does not know while in her presence; tired of Milo, Jerry gets out of the car and bids her farewell.

The next day, Jerry calls Lise at her work, but she tells him to never call her again. Jerry and Milo meet at a cafe, and she informs him a collector is interested in his paintings and she arranged a showing later that day.  Before going to the showing, he goes to the <a href="/wiki/Perfume" title="Perfume">parfumerie</a> where Lise works and she consents to a late dinner with him,. She does not want to be seen eating with him in public, but they share a romantic song and dance on the banks of the <a href="/wiki/Seine" title="Seine">Seine</a> River in the shadows of <a href="/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" class="mw-redirect" title="Notre Dame de Paris">Notre Dame</a>. However, she quickly rushes off to meet Henri after his performance ("<a href="/wiki/I%27ll_Build_a_Stairway_to_Paradise" class="mw-redirect" title="I&#39;ll Build a Stairway to Paradise">I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise</a>"), where Henri tells her he has been asked to go on a tour of America and asks her to marry him.

Later, Adam humorously daydreams he is performing Gershwin's <i><a href="/wiki/Concerto_in_F_(Gershwin)" title="Concerto in F (Gershwin)">Concerto in F for Piano and Orchestra</a></i> for a gala audience in a concert hall. As the scene progresses, Adam is also revealed to be the conductor, other members of the orchestra, and even an enthusiastic audience member applauding himself at the end.

Milo gets Jerry an <a href="/wiki/Studio#Art_studio" title="Studio">art studio</a> and tells him she has planned an exhibition of his work in three months.  He initially refuses the studio because he does not have the money for it, but eventually accepts it under the condition he pay Milo back when his art proceeds allow him.  Roughly a month later and after much courting, Lise abruptly runs off when she and Jerry arrive by taxi at his apartment.  When Jerry complains to Adam, Adam is shocked to realize both Henri and Jerry are involved with the same woman. Henri and Jerry discuss the woman they each love (<span style="padding-right:.15em;">"</span><a href="/wiki/%27S_Wonderful" title="&#39;S Wonderful">'S Wonderful</a>"), unaware she is the same woman.

That night, Jerry and Lise reunite in the same place on the banks of the Seine close to Notre Dame. She informs him she is marrying Henri the next day and going to America. Lise feels a sense of duty to Henri, to whom she feels indebted for keeping her safe during World War II. She and Jerry proclaim their love for each other.

Feeling slighted, Jerry invites Milo to the art students' masked ball and kisses her. At the raucous party, with everyone in black-and-white costumes, they meet Henri and Lise, and Jerry finally tells Milo about his feelings for Lise—soon, Henri overhears Jerry and Lise saying goodbye to each other, and realizes the truth. As Henri and Lise drive away, Jerry daydreams about being with Lise all over Paris to the tune of the George Gershwin composition <i><a href="/wiki/An_American_in_Paris" title="An American in Paris">An American in Paris</a></i>. His reverie is broken by a car horn, the sound of Henri bringing Lise back to him. They embrace as the Gershwin composition (and the film) ends.
