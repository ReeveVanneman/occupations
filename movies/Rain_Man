Charlie Babbitt is in the middle of importing four <a href="/wiki/Lamborghini" title="Lamborghini">Lamborghinis</a> to <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> for resale. He needs to deliver the vehicles to impatient buyers who have already made down payments in order to repay the loan he took out to buy the cars, but the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</a> is holding the cars at the port due to the cars failing <a href="/wiki/Emissions_regulations" class="mw-redirect" title="Emissions regulations">emissions regulations</a>. Charlie directs an employee to lie to the buyers while he stalls his creditor.

When Charlie learns that his estranged father has died, he and his girlfriend Susanna travel to <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati,_Ohio" class="mw-redirect" title="Cincinnati, Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, in order to settle the estate. He learns he is receiving the classic 1949 <a href="/wiki/Buick_Roadmaster" title="Buick Roadmaster">Buick Roadmaster</a> convertible which he and his father fought over, but the bulk of the $3 million estate is going to an unnamed <a href="/wiki/Trustee" title="Trustee">trustee</a>. Through <a href="/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)" title="Social engineering (security)">social engineering</a>, he learns the money is being directed to a <a href="/wiki/Mental_institution" class="mw-redirect" title="Mental institution">mental institution</a>, where he meets his older brother, Raymond Babbitt, of whom he was previously unaware.

Raymond has <a href="/wiki/Savant_syndrome" title="Savant syndrome">savant syndrome</a> and adheres to strict routines. He has <a href="/wiki/Eidetic_memory" title="Eidetic memory">superb recall</a>, but he shows little emotional expression except when in distress. Charlie spirits Raymond out of the mental institution and into a hotel for the night. Susanna becomes upset with the way Charlie treats his brother and leaves. Charlie asks Raymond's doctor, Dr. Gerald R. Bruner, for half the estate in exchange for Raymond's return, but he refuses. Charlie decides to attempt to gain custody of his brother in order to get control of the money.

After Raymond refuses to fly back to Los Angeles, they set out on a cross-country road trip together. During the course of the journey, Charlie learns more about Raymond, including that he is a <a href="/wiki/Mental_calculator" title="Mental calculator">mental calculator</a> with the ability to instantly count hundreds of objects at once, far beyond the normal range of human <a href="/wiki/Subitizing" title="Subitizing">subitizing</a> abilities. He also learns that Raymond actually lived with the family when Charlie was young and he realizes that the comforting figure from his childhood, whom he falsely remembered as an imaginary friend named "Rain Man", was actually Raymond.

They make slow progress because Raymond insists on sticking to his routines, which include watching <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Wapner" title="Joseph Wapner">Judge Wapner</a> on television every day and getting to bed by 11:00 PM. He also objects to traveling on the <a href="/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System" title="Interstate Highway System">interstate</a> after they pass a bad accident.

After the Lamborghinis are seized by his creditor, Charlie finds himself $80,000 in the hole and hatches a plan to return to <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip" title="Las Vegas Strip">Las Vegas</a>, which they passed the night before, and win money at <a href="/wiki/Blackjack" title="Blackjack">blackjack</a> by <a href="/wiki/Card_counting" title="Card counting">counting cards</a>. Though the casino bosses are skeptical that anyone can count cards with a six deck <a href="/wiki/Shoe_(cards)" title="Shoe (cards)">shoe</a>, after reviewing security footage they ask Charlie and Raymond to leave. Charlie has made enough to cover his debts and has reconciled with Susanna who rejoined them in Las Vegas.

Back in Los Angeles, Charlie meets with Dr. Bruner, who offers him $250,000 to walk away from Raymond. Charlie refuses and says that he is no longer upset about what his father left him, but he wants to have a relationship with his brother. At a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist Raymond is shown to be unable to decide for himself what he wants. Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother.

Charlie takes Raymond to the train station where he boards an <a href="/wiki/Amtrak" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> train with Dr. Bruner to return to the mental institution. Charlie promises Raymond that he will visit in two weeks.
