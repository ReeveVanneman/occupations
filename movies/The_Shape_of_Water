Elisa Esposito (<a href="/wiki/Sally_Hawkins" title="Sally Hawkins">Sally Hawkins</a>), who was found abandoned as a child by the side of a river with wounds on her neck, is <a href="/wiki/Muteness" title="Muteness">mute</a> and communicates through <a href="/wiki/Sign_language" title="Sign language">sign language</a>. She lives alone in an apartment above a cinema and works as a cleaner at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore, Maryland, at the height of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. Her only friends are her <a href="/wiki/Closeted" title="Closeted">closeted</a> next-door neighbor Giles (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Jenkins" title="Richard Jenkins">Richard Jenkins</a>), a middle-aged struggling advertising illustrator, and Zelda (<a href="/wiki/Octavia_Spencer" title="Octavia Spencer">Octavia Spencer</a>), a co-worker who serves as her interpreter.

The facility receives a mysterious creature captured from the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_River" title="Amazon River">Amazon River</a> by Colonel Richard Strickland (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Shannon" title="Michael Shannon">Michael Shannon</a>) who is in charge of the project to study it. Believing it is just a wild beast, Strickland treats it brutally, repeatedly shocking it with his electric <a href="/wiki/Cattle_prod" title="Cattle prod">cattle prod</a>. Curious about the creature, Elisa discovers it is a male humanoid amphibian (<a href="/wiki/Doug_Jones_(actor)" title="Doug Jones (actor)">Doug Jones</a>). She begins visiting him in secret and the two form a close bond as she teaches him sign language.

Seeking to exploit the Amphibian Man for an American advantage in the <a href="/wiki/Space_Race" title="Space Race">space race</a>, General Frank Hoyt (<a href="/wiki/Nick_Searcy" title="Nick Searcy">Nick Searcy</a>) is eventually persuaded by Strickland to <a href="/wiki/Vivisection" title="Vivisection">vivisect</a> it. One scientist, Robert Hoffstetler (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Stuhlbarg" title="Michael Stuhlbarg">Michael Stuhlbarg</a>) - who is really a <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> spy named Dimitri Mosenkov - pleads unsuccessfully to keep the Amphibian Man alive for further study and, at the same time, is ordered by his Soviet handlers to <a href="/wiki/Euthanasia" title="Euthanasia">euthanize</a> the creature. When Elisa overhears the American plans for the Amphibian Man, she persuades Giles to help her free him. Hoffstetler stumbles upon Elisa's plot in progress and chooses to help her. Though initially reluctant, Zelda also becomes involved in the successful escape.

Elisa keeps the Amphibian Man in her bathtub. She plans to release him into a nearby canal when it rains to give access to the ocean in several days' time. Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, among others, but learns nothing. Back at the apartment, Giles discovers the Amphibian Man devouring one of his cats. Startled, the Amphibian Man slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. He gets as far as the cinema downstairs, luckily empty of patrons, before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. He touches Giles on his balding head and his wounded arm, and the next morning Giles discovers his hair has begun growing back and the wounds on his arm have healed. After initially walking away, Elisa has sex with the Amphibian Man in her shower. For a later encounter, she fills the bathroom completely with water, which eventually begins to cause water to drip into the theater below. The upset theater owner alerts Giles, who then enters the apartment and opens the bathroom door, interrupting the tryst.

Hoyt unexpectedly arrives and asks for the status of the case. When Strickland questions how much experimentation is enough, he is told he has 36 hours to recover the Amphibian Man or his career and life will be over. Meanwhile, Hoffstetler is told he will be <a href="/wiki/Extraction_(military)" title="Extraction (military)">extracted</a> in two days. As the planned release date approaches, the Amphibian Man's health starts deteriorating. Hoffstetler goes to meet his handlers with Strickland tailing him. At the rendezvous, Hoffstetler is shot by a handler before Strickland kills him and then continuously tortures Hoffstetler for information (knowing he is a spy by virtue of having heard him speak Russian to his handler) while asking for the name and rank of who has the creature. Before dying, Hoffstetler implicates Elisa and Zelda. Strickland savagely threatens Zelda in her home until her husband Brewster (Martin Roach) reveals that Elisa has the Amphibian Man (having overheard her conversations). After Strickland's departure, Zelda immediately calls Elisa, warning her to get the creature out immediately. An enraged Strickland arrives and searches Elisa's empty apartment until he finds a calendar note revealing where she plans to release the Amphibian Man.

At the canal, Elisa and Giles are bidding farewell to the creature when Strickland arrives, knocks Giles down, and shoots the Amphibian Man and Elisa. The Amphibian Man quickly heals himself and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the Amphibian Man takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, where he heals her. When he applies his healing touch to the scars on Elisa's neck, they open to reveal <a href="/wiki/Gill" title="Gill">gills</a> like his; she jolts back to life, and the two embrace. In a closing <a href="/wiki/Voice-over" title="Voice-over">voice-over</a> narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived "happily ever after in love" with the Amphibian Man.
