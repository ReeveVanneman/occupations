In the opening narration to the movie, Lester Burnham describes his life in the suburbs, living with his wife and daughter. Lester is a middle-aged family man who is unfulfilled by his job as an advertising executive and magazine writer. He is unhappily married to Carolyn, a talkative, neurotic, yet fiercely ambitious real estate broker who grows red roses in their yard. The Burnham's teenage daughter, Jane, abhors her parents and has low self-esteem. The Burnhams' new neighbors are the Fitts, a family of three: <a href="/wiki/Homophobia" title="Homophobia">homophobic</a> retired <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> <a href="/wiki/Colonel_(United_States)" title="Colonel (United States)">Colonel</a> Frank, his near-<a href="/wiki/Catatonic" class="mw-redirect" title="Catatonic">catatonic</a> wife, Barbara, and their 18-year-old son, Ricky, who constantly films his surroundings with a camcorder, collecting hundreds of recordings on videotapes in his bedroom. His part-time jobs as a bar caterer and waiter serve as a front for his secret <a href="/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" title="Cannabis (drug)">marijuana</a> dealings. His father is a strict disciplinarian who previously had sent Ricky to a military school, and then briefly had him committed to a psychiatric hospital after he got kicked out. Jim Olmeyer and Jim Berkley, a gay couple who live in the house next to the Burnhams, welcome the Fitts to the neighborhood. In the car, Frank reveals his homophobia while he angrily discusses the incident with his son.

After seeing her perform at a high school basketball game with Jane, Lester becomes infatuated with Jane's attractive but vain cheerleader friend, Angela Hayes. He starts immediately having sexual fantasies about Angela, where red rose petals are a recurring motif. His wife begins an extramarital <a href="/wiki/Affair" title="Affair">affair</a> with her married business rival, Buddy Kane. When Lester's boss and "efficiency expert", Brad, tells him that he is to be laid off, he blackmails Brad for $60,000. Lester continues his "liberation" (making drastic changes to his life) by taking a low-skilled entry-level job at fast-food restaurant Smileys, trading his Toyota Camry for his dream car – a 1970 <a href="/wiki/Pontiac_Firebird" title="Pontiac Firebird">Pontiac Firebird</a> – and starting to <a href="/wiki/Work-out" class="mw-redirect" title="Work-out">work out</a> after he overhears Angela tell his daughter that she would find him sexually attractive if he got in shape. He begins smoking marijuana supplied by Ricky. The two girls' friendship wanes after Jane starts a relationship with Ricky. The pair bond when Ricky shares what he considers the most beautiful thing he has ever filmed: a plastic bag being blown around by the wind.

Lester discovers his wife's infidelity, but doesn't overreact, instead telling her bluntly that she can no longer ever boss him around. Buddy decides to end the affair, fearing an expensive divorce. Frank becomes suspicious of Lester's friendship with his son when he finds videotape footage of Lester in the nude, lifting weights, which Ricky actually only captured by chance. After spying on Lester when his son goes over to visit, Frank mistakenly concludes the pair is sexually involved, so he confronts and beats his son, and accuses him of being homosexual. Fed up with his <a href="/wiki/Authoritarian" class="mw-redirect" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> personality, Ricky lies to his father, claiming that he is gay, and makes plans to leave home. Meanwhile, Carolyn is sitting in her car as the rain comes down. She takes a gun out of the glove box as a voice on the radio talks about "not being a victim".

Jane argues with Angela after she flirts with her dad. Ricky appears during the argument and convinces Jane to go with him to New York City. He tells Angela that she is "ugly, boring, and ordinary" to hurt her feelings. Meanwhile, Frank goes to visit Lester in his garage, and then attempts to kiss him on the lips. Lester rebuffs the ex-colonel, who retires to his house in tears. In her car, Carolyn puts the gun in her handbag, shouting, "I refuse to be a victim!" Lester finds Angela distraught, sitting alone in the darkened living room of his house. She wants reassurance that she is not "ordinary". He tells her she is beautiful, so she kisses him.

Carolyn drives through the rain and the dark, rehearsing a confession to Lester. On the couch, as Lester undresses Angela to have sex, the girl confesses to actually being a virgin, despite all her bragging to the contrary. Lester is confused for a moment before he chooses to halt all amorous activities. He instead becomes like a dad as he comforts her. The two of them bond in the nighttime kitchen over their shared frustrations. When Angela goes to the bathroom, Lester smiles at a family photograph in his kitchen. Then he is shot in the back of the head by an unseen intruder. Ricky and Jane find her dad's body. Jane stands in shock; Ricky gets close to the bloody head and smiles; Carolyn reacts to her dead husband by breaking down and crying in front of his closet. When Frank returns home with blood on his white shirt, a gun is shown to be missing from his collection.

In the closing narration to the movie, Lester describes the experience of reliving a night at boy scouts. He says that, despite the unfairness of his death, he is not angry. Instead, he poetically describes how happy he is because there is "so much beauty" in the world.
