Corleone <a href="/wiki/Caporegime" title="Caporegime">caporegime</a> <a href="/wiki/Frank_Pentangeli" title="Frank Pentangeli">Frank Pentangeli</a> is dismayed that Michael will not help him defend his Brooklyn territory against the Rosato brothers, who work for Michael's business partner <a href="/wiki/Hyman_Roth" title="Hyman Roth">Hyman Roth</a>. That night, Michael leaves Nevada after surviving an assassination attempt at his home.


<dl><dd><i>In 1917, Vito Corleone lives in New York with his wife <a href="/wiki/Carmela_Corleone" title="Carmela Corleone">Carmela</a> and son <a href="/wiki/Sonny_Corleone" title="Sonny Corleone">Sonny</a>.

Michael suspects Roth of planning the assassination, but meets him in Miami and feigns ignorance. In New York, Pentangeli attempts to maintain Michael's façade by making peace with the Rosato family but they attempt to kill him. Roth, Michael, and several of their partners travel to <a href="/wiki/Havana" title="Havana">Havana</a> to discuss their future Cuban business prospects under the cooperative government of <a href="/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista" title="Fulgencio Batista">Fulgencio Batista</a>; Michael becomes reluctant after reconsidering the viability of the ongoing <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Revolution" title="Cuban Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a>. On New Year's Eve, he tries to have Roth and Roth's right-hand man Johnny Ola killed, but Roth survives when Michael's bodyguard is discovered and shot by police. Michael accuses his brother <a href="/wiki/Fredo_Corleone" title="Fredo Corleone">Fredo</a> of betrayal after Fredo inadvertently reveals that he'd met with Ola previously. Batista abruptly abdicates due to <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Santa_Clara" title="Battle of Santa Clara">rebel advances</a>; during the ensuing chaos, Michael, Fredo, and Roth separately escape to the United States. Back home, Michael learns that his wife <a href="/wiki/Kay_Adams-Corleone" title="Kay Adams-Corleone">Kay</a> has miscarried.


<dl><dd><i>By 1920, Vito and Carmela have had two more sons, Fredo and Michael. Vito's criminal conduct attracts the attention of Fanucci, who <a href="/wiki/Pizzo_(extortion)" class="mw-redirect" title="Pizzo (extortion)">extorts</a> him. His partners, Clemenza and <a href="/wiki/Salvatore_Tessio" title="Salvatore Tessio">Salvatore Tessio</a>, wish to avoid trouble by paying in full, but Vito insists that he can convince Fanucci to accept a smaller payment by making him "an offer he won't refuse". During a neighborhood <a href="/wiki/Calendar_of_saints" title="Calendar of saints">festa</a>, he stalks Fanucci to his apartment and shoots him dead.</i></dd></dl>
In Washington, D.C., a <a href="/wiki/United_States_congressional_committee" title="United States congressional committee">Senate committee</a> on organized crime is investigating the Corleone family. Having survived the earlier attempt on his life, Pentangeli agrees to testify against Michael, who he believes had double-crossed him, and is placed under witness protection.


<dl><dd><i>Now a respected figure in his community, Vito is approached for help by a widow who is being evicted. After an unsuccessful negotiation with Vito, the widow's landlord asks around, learns of Vito's reputation, and hastily agrees to let the widow stay on terms very favorable to her. In the meantime, Vito and his partners are becoming more and more successful, with the establishment of their business, "Genco Pura Olive Oil".</i></dd></dl>
On returning to Nevada, Fredo privately explains himself to Michael; feeling resentful at being disregarded, he had helped Roth in expectation of something in return—unaware, he claims, of the plot on Michael's life. He also informs Michael that the Senate lawyer, Questadt, is working under Roth's payroll. Michael responds by disowning Fredo. Michael is unable to reach the heavily-guarded Pentangeli, so sends for Pentangeli's brother from Sicily, resulting in Pentangeli renouncing his previous statement; the hearing dissolves in uproar. Afterwards, Kay reveals to Michael that her miscarriage was actually an abortion, and that she intends to take their children away from Michael's criminal life. Outraged, Michael takes custody of the children and banishes Kay from the family.


<dl><dd><i>In 1923, Vito visits Sicily for the first time since emigrating. He and business partner Tommasino are admitted to Don Ciccio's compound, ostensibly to ask for Ciccio's blessing on their olive oil business. Vito exacts his childhood vengeance by knifing Ciccio after revealing his old identity, but Tommasino is shot in the leg and suffers a permanent disability during their escape.</i></dd></dl>
Carmela Corleone dies. At the funeral, Michael appears to forgive Fredo.

Roth is refused <a href="/wiki/Right_of_asylum" title="Right of asylum">asylum</a> and denied <a href="/wiki/Law_of_Return" title="Law of Return">entry to Israel</a>. He is forced to return to the United States. Over the dissent of <a href="/wiki/Consigliere" title="Consigliere">consigliere</a> <a href="/wiki/Tom_Hagen" title="Tom Hagen">Tom Hagen</a>, Michael sends caporegime Rocco Lampone to intercept and shoot Roth on arrival. Rocco is shot dead by federal agents after completing his mission. At the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Federal_Witness_Protection_Program" title="United States Federal Witness Protection Program">witness protection compound</a>, Hagen reminds Pentangeli that failed plotters against the Roman Emperor often committed suicide and assures him that his family will be cared for. Pentangeli later slits his wrists in his bathtub. <a href="/wiki/Al_Neri" title="Al Neri">Al Neri</a>, acting on Michael's orders, assassinates Fredo out on the lake.


<dl><dd><i>On December 7, 1941, the Corleone family gathers in their dining room to surprise Vito for his birthday.
