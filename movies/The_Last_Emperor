In 1950, Puyi has been kept in custody for five years, since the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> captured him during the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria" title="Soviet invasion of Manchuria">Soviet Union entry into the Pacific War in 1945</a>. In the recently established <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" class="mw-redirect" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>, Puyi arrives as a <a href="/wiki/Political_prisoner" title="Political prisoner">political prisoner</a> and <a href="/wiki/War_criminal" class="mw-redirect" title="War criminal">war criminal</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Fushun_War_Criminals_Management_Centre" title="Fushun War Criminals Management Centre">Fushun Prison</a>. Soon after his arrival, Puyi attempts suicide, but is quickly revived and told he must stand trial.

42 years earlier,  in 1908, a toddler Puyi is summoned to the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_City" title="Forbidden City">Forbidden City</a> by the dying <a href="/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi" title="Empress Dowager Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>. After telling him that the <a href="/wiki/Guangxu_Emperor" title="Guangxu Emperor">previous emperor</a> had died earlier that day, with her last words, Cixi tells Puyi that he will be the next emperor. After his coronation, Puyi, frightened by his new surroundings, repeatedly expresses his wish to go home, which is denied. Despite having scores of palace <a href="/wiki/Eunuch" title="Eunuch">eunuchs</a> and maids to wait on him, his only real friend is his <a href="/wiki/Wet_nurse" title="Wet nurse">wet nurse</a>, Ar Mo, who accompanied him and his father to the palace on the Empress Dowager's summons.

The next section of the film continues the series of chronological flashbacks showing Puyi's early life intermixed with his imprisonment in the 1950s. His upbringing is confined entirely to the imperial palace, which he is not allowed to leave. When he is about ten, he is visited by his younger brother, <a href="/wiki/Pujie" title="Pujie">Pujie</a>, who tells him he is no longer Emperor and that China is a <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%9349)" class="mw-redirect" title="Republic of China (1912â€“49)">republic</a>; that same day, Ar Mo is made to leave him. In 1919, the kindly <a href="/wiki/Scotsman" class="mw-redirect" title="Scotsman">Scotsman</a> <a href="/wiki/Reginald_Johnston" title="Reginald Johnston">Reginald Johnston</a> is appointed as Puyi's tutor and gives him a Western-style education. Puyi becomes increasingly desirous to leave the Forbidden City. Johnston, wary of the courtiers' expensive lifestyle, convinces Puyi that the best way of achieving this is by marrying; Puyi subsequently weds <a href="/wiki/Empress_Wanrong" title="Empress Wanrong">Wanrong</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Wenxiu" title="Wenxiu">Wenxiu</a> as a secondary consort.

Now the master of his own home, Puyi sets about reforming the Forbidden City, including expelling the thieving palace eunuchs. However, in 1924, he himself is expelled from the palace and exiled to <a href="/wiki/Tianjin" title="Tianjin">Tientsin</a> following the <a href="/wiki/Beijing_Coup" title="Beijing Coup">Beijing Coup</a>. He leads a decadent life as a playboy and Anglophile, and when the Japanese invade <a href="/wiki/Manchuria" title="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> he sides with them. During this time Wenxiu divorces him, but Wanrong remains and eventually succumbs to <a href="/wiki/Opium" title="Opium">opium</a> addiction. In 1934 the Japanese crown him "Emperor" of their <a href="/wiki/Puppet_state" title="Puppet state">puppet state</a> of <a href="/wiki/Manchukuo" title="Manchukuo">Manchukuo</a>, though his supposed political supremacy is undermined at every turn. He remains nominal ruler of the region until  his capture by the Red Army at the end of the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" class="mw-redirect" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>.

Under the "Communist re-education programme" for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Japanese invaders for war crimes during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War" title="Second Sino-Japanese War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>. Finally, after a heated discussion with the camp commandant and upon watching a film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi recants his previous stance and is considered rehabilitated by the government; he is subsequently set free in 1959.

The final minutes of the film show a flash-forward to 1967 during the rise of <a href="/wiki/Mao_Zedong" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Cult_of_personality" title="Cult of personality">cult of personality</a> and the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Revolution" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>. By now, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant <a href="/wiki/Proletarian" class="mw-redirect" title="Proletarian">proletarian</a> existence. On his way home from work, he happens upon a <a href="/wiki/Red_Guards_(China)" class="mw-redirect" title="Red Guards (China)">Red Guard</a> parade, complete with children playing <a href="/wiki/Pentatonic_scale" title="Pentatonic scale">pentatonic</a> music on accordions <i>en masse</i> and dancers who dance the rejection of landlordism by the Communists. His prison camp commander, who helped him greatly during his rehabilitation, is forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans, and is one of the political prisoners now punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade.

Puyi later visits the Forbidden City as an ordinary tourist. He meets an assertive little boy wearing the red scarf of the <a href="/wiki/Young_Pioneers_of_China" title="Young Pioneers of China">Pioneer Movement</a>. The young Communist orders Puyi to step away from the throne. However, Puyi proves to the boy that he was indeed the <a href="/wiki/Emperor_of_China" title="Emperor of China">Son of Heaven</a>, proceeding to approach the throne. Behind it, Puyi finds a 60-year-old pet cricket that he was given by palace official <a href="/wiki/Chen_Baochen" title="Chen Baochen">Chen Baochen</a> on his coronation day and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but the emperor has disappeared.

In 1987, a tour guide is leading a group through the palace. Stopping in front of the throne, the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, concluding that he died in 1967.
