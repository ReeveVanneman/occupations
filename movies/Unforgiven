In 1881 in Big Whiskey, <a href="/wiki/Wyoming" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, two cowboys, Quick Mike and "Davey-Boy" Bunting, attack and disfigure prostitute Delilah Fitzgerald with a knife after she laughs at Quick Mike's small penis. As punishment, local sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett orders the cowboys to pay compensation in the form of several horses to the brothel owner, Skinny Dubois. The rest of the prostitutes are outraged by the sheriff's decision and offer a $1,000 reward to anyone who kills the cowboys. This infuriates Little Bill when he hears of it, and furthers his resolve to enforce the law that does not allow guns in town.

Miles away in <a href="/wiki/Kansas" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>, a boastful young man calling himself the "<a href="/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson_Model_3#Schofield_Revolver" title="Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3">Schofield</a> Kid" visits the pig farm of reformed outlaw William Munny, seeking to recruit him to help kill the cowboys and claim the reward. In his youth, Munny was a notorious outlaw and murderer, but he is now a repentant widower raising two children. Initially refusing to help, Munny recognizes that his farm is failing, which puts his children's future in jeopardy, and so reconsiders and sets off to catch up with the Kid. On his way, Munny recruits his friend Ned Logan, another retired gunfighter, to help with the task.

Back in Wyoming, British-born gunfighter "English Bob", an old acquaintance and rival of Little Bill, is also seeking the reward. He arrives in Big Whiskey with a biographer, W. W. Beauchamp, who is from the east and uncritically believes the tales Bob is telling about the noble exploits of his past. Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob and Bill beats him savagely, hoping to discourage other would-be assassins from attempting to claim the bounty. The next morning Bill ejects Bob from town, but Beauchamp decides to stay and write about Bill, who debunks many of the romantic notions Beauchamp has about the wild west, including the importance of being fast on the draw in winning a shootout.

Munny, Logan and the Kid arrive in town during a rainstorm and head into the saloon/whorehouse to meet with the prostitutes and learn the cowboys' location. Delirious with fever after riding in the rain, Munny is sitting alone in the saloon when Little Bill and his deputies arrive to confront him. Not realizing Munny's identity and believing him to be just another drunk, Little Bill beats him up and kicks him out of the saloon for carrying a pistol. Logan and the Kid, upstairs getting "advances in kind" on their payment from the prostitutes, escape through a back window. The three regroup at a barn outside town, where they nurse Munny back to health.

Three days later, they ambush and kill Bunting. Logan, who gravely wounded Bunting but was unable to finish him off, realizes he is no longer able to perform as a hired gun and resolves to return home. However Munny feels they must finish the job. Munny and the Kid head to the cowboys' ranch, where the Kid ambushes Quick Mike in an outhouse and kills him. After they escape, a distraught Kid confesses he had never killed anyone before and renounces life as a gunfighter. When one of the prostitutes meets the two men outside of Big Whiskey to give them the reward they learn that Logan had been captured by Little Bill's men and that Bill had tortured him into revealing Munny's true identity, with Logan dying from the torture. The Kid heads back to Kansas to deliver the reward money to Munny's children and Logan's wife, while an embittered Munny, finishing Logan's bottle of whiskey after years of sobriety, returns to town to take revenge on Little Bill.

That night, Munny arrives and sees Logan's corpse displayed in a coffin outside the saloon with a sign reading "<style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r872446130">.mw-parser-output .smallcaps{font-variant:small-caps}</style><span class="smallcaps">This Is What Happens To Assassins Around Here</span>". Inside, Little Bill has assembled a posse to pursue Munny and the Kid. Munny walks in alone to confront the posse and kills Dubois, the owner of the saloon/brothel. In the frantic shootout that follows, Munny shoots Bill and kills several of his deputies. Crouching behind cover, he orders the others to leave the saloon. Critically wounded, Bill gasps out to Munny that he doesn't deserve to die in this way; Munny replies, "Deserve's got nothing to do with it", and kills him. Munny then leaves Big Whiskey, after screaming out a warning to the townsfolk that he will return for more vengeance if Logan is not buried properly or if any of the prostitutes are harmed.

A title card epilogue says that Munny may have moved with his children to <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, where he prospered in dry goods.
