18-year-old <a href="/wiki/Jamal_Malik_(character)" title="Jamal Malik (character)">Jamal Malik</a>, an Indian Muslim from the <a href="/wiki/Dharavi" title="Dharavi">Dharavi</a> <a href="/wiki/Slum" title="Slum">slum</a>, is a contestant on the <a href="/wiki/Kaun_Banega_Crorepati" title="Kaun Banega Crorepati">Indian version of <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i></a>, and is one question away from the grand prize. However, before the <span class="nowrap"><span style="white-space: nowrap">₹</span>20 million</span> (US$280,000) question, he is detained and tortured by the police, who suspect him of cheating because of the impossibility of a simple "slumdog" with very little education knowing all the answers. Jamal recounts, through <a href="/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashbacks</a>, the incidents in his life which provided him with each answer.

Jamal's flashbacks begin with his managing, at age five, to obtain the autograph of <a href="/wiki/Bollywood" title="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> star <a href="/wiki/Amitabh_Bachchan" title="Amitabh Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, where he had to jump into a toilet cesspit when his brother Salim blocked the door, who later sells the autograph, followed immediately by the death of his mother during the <a href="/wiki/Bombay_riots" title="Bombay riots">Bombay riots</a>. As they flee the riot, the brothers meet Latika, a girl from their slum. Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be the "third musketeer", a character from the <a href="/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas" title="Alexandre Dumas">Alexandre Dumas</a> novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers" title="The Three Musketeers">The Three Musketeers</a></i> (which they had been studying—albeit not very diligently—in school), whose name they do not know.

The three are found by Maman—a <a href="/wiki/Organised_crime_in_India" title="Organised crime in India">gangster</a> who <a href="/wiki/Child_trafficking_in_India" title="Child trafficking in India">tricks and then trains street children</a> into becoming <a href="/wiki/Begging" title="Begging">beggars</a>. When Salim discovers Maman is blinding the children in order to make them more effective beggars, he flees with Jamal and Latika to a departing train. Latika fails to board the train as Salim purposefully lets go of her hand, in revenge for an extremely embarrassing prank that Latika had played on Salim. This resulted in her being recaptured by Maman. Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, <a href="/wiki/Pickpocketing" title="Pickpocketing">picking pockets</a>, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the <a href="/wiki/Taj_Mahal" title="Taj Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>, where they also steal people's shoes. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering that she is being raised by Maman to be a prostitute, soon to fetch him a high price as a <a href="/wiki/Virginity" title="Virginity">virgin</a>. The brothers rescue her, and while escaping Maman they shoot him to death. Salim then manages to get a job with Javed—Maman's rival crime lord. Back at their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, whereas Latika persuades Jamal to obey his brother and leave.

Years later, Jamal, now a <a href="/wiki/Chaiwala" title="Chaiwala">Chaiwala</a> in an Indian <a href="/wiki/Call_centre" title="Call centre">call centre</a>, searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika. He fails in finding Latika, while succeeding in finding Salim, now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's crime organization. Jamal reproaches Salim, who then pleads for forgiveness, and offers him to stay in his luxurious apartment. Jamal later bluffs his way into Javed's residence to reunite with Latika but as he professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her. Jamal nevertheless promises to wait for her every day at five o'clock at the <a href="/wiki/Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus_railway_station" title="Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station">VT</a> station. Latika attempts to meet him there, but is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim, and once Javed moves to another house, outside Mumbai, the two again lose contact. Jamal becomes a contestant on <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>, knowing that she watches the show regularly. Much to the consternation of Prem Kumar, the show's host, Jamal becomes a wonder across India. During a break before Jamal answers the penultimate question, Kumar tries to fool him by feeding him the wrong answer whilst in the <a href="/wiki/Public_toilet" title="Public toilet">men's room</a>. After the break Jamal uses the <a href="/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire%3F#Lifelines" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?">50/50 lifeline</a>, leaving Kumar's answer and one other, but chooses the other one.

The episode ends before the final question can be asked, and Kumar leads Jamal out of the studio where he is immediately forced into a police van. After an initial <a href="/wiki/Battery_(crime)" title="Battery (crime)">beating</a>, the police inspector listens to Jamal's explanation of how he reached each answer. Finding all of them "bizarrely plausible", he allows him back on the show. At Javed's <a href="/wiki/Safe_house" title="Safe house">safehouse</a>, Latika sees Jamal on the news and Salim, in an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal. Latika is reluctant out of fear of Javed, but agrees and escapes. Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, waiting for Javed and his men as they realize that he let Latika free. Jamal's final question is the name of the third musketeer in <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, which he never learned. Jamal uses his "Phone-A-Friend" lifeline to call Salim's phone, as it is the only phone number he knows. Latika answers the phone, and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe. Relieved, Jamal arbitrarily picks <a href="/wiki/Aramis" title="Aramis">Aramis</a>, the right answer, and wins the grand prize. Javed hears Latika on the show and realises that Salim has betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door but Salim kills Javed before he is shot, gasping, "<a href="/wiki/Takbir" title="Takbir">God is great</a>". Soon thereafter, Jamal and Latika meet on the platform at the railway station and they kiss.
