The movie begins with Detective Graham Waters (<a href="/wiki/Don_Cheadle" title="Don Cheadle">Don Cheadle</a>) and his partner Ria (<a href="/wiki/Jennifer_Esposito" title="Jennifer Esposito">Jennifer Esposito</a>) being involved in a minor collision with a car being driven by Kim Lee (Alexis Rhee). A subsequent exchange of racially charged insults occurs. The next time we see Waters he is arriving at a crime scene where the body of a "dead kid" has been discovered. We then jump to Farhad (<a href="/wiki/Shaun_Toub" title="Shaun Toub">Shaun Toub</a>), a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri (<a href="/wiki/Bahar_Soomekh" title="Bahar Soomekh">Bahar Soomekh</a>) in a gun shop arguing over what bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as "<a href="/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama</a>." Farhad is then commanded to leave the store and Dorri becomes responsible for the choice. The next scene depicts two black men, Anthony (<a href="/wiki/Ludacris" title="Ludacris">Ludacris</a>) and Peter (<a href="/wiki/Larenz_Tate" title="Larenz Tate">Larenz Tate</a>), carjacking District Attorney Rick (<a href="/wiki/Brendan_Fraser" title="Brendan Fraser">Brendan Fraser</a>) and his wife Jean (<a href="/wiki/Sandra_Bullock" title="Sandra Bullock">Sandra Bullock</a>). Later, at the couple's house, the Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz <a href="/wiki/Michael_Pe%C3%B1a" title="Michael Peña">(Michael Peña</a>) overhears Jean degrading him for his tattoos and dress.

John Ryan (<a href="/wiki/Matt_Dillon" title="Matt Dillon">Matt Dillon</a>) and his partner Tom Hansen (<a href="/wiki/Ryan_Phillippe" title="Ryan Phillippe">Ryan Phillippe</a>) pull over an SUV being driven by director Cameron Thayer (<a href="/wiki/Terrence_Howard" title="Terrence Howard">Terrence Howard</a>) and his wife Christine (<a href="/wiki/Thandie_Newton" title="Thandie Newton">Thandie Newton</a>). After mouthing off, Christine is sexually assaulted by Ryan under the auspices of a pat-down. 

In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a Korean man while passing a parked van, dump him in front of a hospital, and drive away. Daniel's next call is to replace a lock at Farhad's shop, but when Daniel warns Farhad that the real problem is the door, Farhad won't listen. The next day, Farhad finds that his store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti. Waters visits his hard drug-abusing mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.

Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. Although she resists frantically at first, with the help of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls the terrified Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter carjack another navigator, which happens to be Cameron's. Only after opening the door do they realize that Cameron is black. Police officers arrive on the scene and there is a chase that ends with Cameron and Anthony in Cameron's car on a dead end residential road. Hansen is one of the pursuing officers and vouches for Cameron because of the part he played in the assault of Cameron's wife.

Farhad locates Daniel's house and waits in ambush, but as he confronts Daniel and shoots, Daniel's daughter jumps into Daniel's arms, attempting to protect her father. Everyone watches in horror as Daniel clutches his daughter, but they soon realize that she has not been shot and the family retreats inside. Farhad tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. Dorri is shown with the box of blanks she had purchased.

Hansen pulls over to pick up a hitchhiking Peter, although throughout the drive Hansen becomes more and more suspicious of Peter's intentions. Peter offends Hansen by suddenly beginning to laugh, and when Peter reaches for his pocket, Hansen shoots. In Peter's hand is a statuette similar to the one on Hansen's dash and, horrified, Hansen hides the body in some nearby bushes and burns his car. Waters arrives at the scene with his partner and the connection is made that Peter is his missing brother and the "dead boy." Later, at the morgue, Dorri is revealed to be the coroner. 

Anthony decides to steal the van of the Korean man he accidentally hit and, when he drops it off at a chop shop he frequents, he discovers a number of Cambodian immigrants locked in the back of the van. The chop shop owner offers him $500 per immigrant but Anthony has other plans. He is seen driving into <a href="/wiki/Chinatown,_Los_Angeles" title="Chinatown, Los Angeles">Chinatown</a> and setting the Cambodian people free, passing a car crash on his way out.
